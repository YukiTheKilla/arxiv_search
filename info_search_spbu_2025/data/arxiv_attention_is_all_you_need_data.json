    "summary": "We study conditions under which transformers using soft attention can\nsimulate hard attention, that is, effectively focus all attention on a subset\nof positions. First, we examine several subclasses of languages recognized by\nhard-attention transformers, which can be defined in variants of linear\ntemporal logic. We demonstrate how soft-attention transformers can compute\nformulas of these logics using unbounded positional embeddings or temperature\nscaling. Second, we demonstrate how temperature scaling allows softmax\ntransformers to simulate general hard-attention transformers, using a\ntemperature that depends on the minimum gap between the maximum attention\nscores and other attention scores.",

These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision\ntasks including object detection and image segmentation.

In this\nwork, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any\nTransformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and\nTransformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these\nto the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure\nself-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii)\nencoder-decoder attention.

    "summary": "Recently, Transformers have shown promising performance in various vision\ntasks. To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global\nself-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local\nregion to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a\nsingle attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context\nmodeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention\n(PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region.\nCompared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation\nand memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual\ninformation under the similar computation complexity with previous local\nself-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general\nVision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale\nTransformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the\nmodel size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224 ImageNet-1K\nclassification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones.

However, self-attention and multi-head attention\ncannot be easily applied for streaming or online ASR.

For multi-head\nattention in Transformer ASR, it is not easy to model monotonic alignments in\ndifferent heads. To overcome these two limits, we integrate sparse attention\nand monotonic attention into Transformer-based ASR.

    "summary": "Vision Transformers achieved outstanding performance in many computer vision\ntasks. Early Vision Transformers such as ViT and DeiT adopt global\nself-attention, which is computationally expensive when the number of patches\nis large. To improve efficiency, recent Vision Transformers adopt local\nself-attention mechanisms, where self-attention is computed within local\nwindows. Despite the fact that window-based local self-attention significantly\nboosts efficiency, it fails to capture the relationships between distant but\nsimilar patches in the image plane. To overcome this limitation of image-space\nlocal attention, in this paper, we further exploit the locality of patches in\nthe feature space. We group the patches into multiple clusters using their\nfeatures, and self-attention is computed within every cluster. Such\nfeature-space local attention effectively captures the connections between\npatches across different local windows but still relevant. We propose a\nBilateral lOcal Attention vision Transformer (BOAT), which integrates\nfeature-space local attention with image-space local attention.

Visual processing in these\nmodels incorporates computational models that are claimed to implement\nattention mechanisms. Despite an increasing body of work that attempts to\nunderstand the role of attention mechanisms in vision transformers, their\neffect is largely unknown. Here, we asked if the attention mechanisms in vision\ntransformers exhibit similar effects as those known in human visual attention.\nTo answer this question, we revisited the attention formulation in these models\nand found that despite the name, computationally, these models perform a\nspecial class of relaxation labeling with similarity grouping effects.\nAdditionally, whereas modern experimental findings reveal that human visual\nattention involves both feed-forward and feedback mechanisms, the purely\nfeed-forward architecture of vision transformers suggests that attention in\nthese models will not have the same effects as those known in humans. To\nquantify these observations, we evaluated grouping performance in a family of\nvision transformers. Our results suggest that self-attention modules group\nfigures in the stimuli based on similarity in visual features such as color.\nAlso, in a singleton detection experiment as an instance of saliency detection,\nwe studied if these models exhibit similar effects as those of feed-forward\nvisual salience mechanisms utilized in human visual attention.

To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

    "summary": "Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically\nuninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known\nas attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the\nDifferential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention\nscores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the\nIntegral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention\nby integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach\nmitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical\nfor model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model\noutperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on\nwell-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our\nanalysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer\nlayers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively\nbalances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.",

Many existing works explore to accelerate\nTransformers by computing sparse self-attention instead of a dense one, which\nusually attends to tokens at certain positions or randomly selected tokens.\nHowever, manually selected or random tokens may be uninformative for context\nmodeling. In this paper, we propose Smart Bird, which is an efficient and\neffective Transformer with learnable sparse attention. In Smart Bird, we first\ncompute a sketched attention matrix with a single-head low-dimensional\nTransformer, which aims to find potential important interactions between\ntokens.

    "summary": "The attention module is the key component in Transformers. While the global\nattention mechanism offers high expressiveness, its excessive computational\ncost restricts its applicability in various scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose a novel attention paradigm, Agent Attention, to strike a favorable\nbalance between computational efficiency and representation power.\nSpecifically, the Agent Attention, denoted as a quadruple $(Q, A, K, V)$,\nintroduces an additional set of agent tokens $A$ into the conventional\nattention module. The agent tokens first act as the agent for the query tokens\n$Q$ to aggregate information from $K$ and $V$, and then broadcast the\ninformation back to $Q$. Given the number of agent tokens can be designed to be\nmuch smaller than the number of query tokens, the agent attention is\nsignificantly more efficient than the widely adopted Softmax attention, while\npreserving global context modelling capability. Interestingly, we show that the\nproposed agent attention is equivalent to a generalized form of linear\nattention. Therefore, agent attention seamlessly integrates the powerful\nSoftmax attention and the highly efficient linear attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of agent attention with various\nvision Transformers and across diverse vision tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection, semantic segmentation and image generation.\nNotably, agent attention has shown remarkable performance in high-resolution\nscenarios, owning to its linear attention nature.

Also, due to the model's scale, the cost of\nfine-tuning the model to the new domain is large. Nonparametric Variational\nInformation Bottleneck (NVIB) has been proposed as a regulariser for training\ncross-attention in Transformers, potentially addressing the overfitting\nproblem.

    "summary": "Despite the popularity of transformers in practice, their architectures are\nempirically designed and neither mathematically justified nor interpretable.\nMoreover, as indicated by many empirical studies, some components of\ntransformer architectures may be redundant. To derive a fully interpretable\ntransformer architecture with only necessary components, we contend that the\ngoal of representation learning is to compress a set of noisy initial token\nrepresentations towards a mixture of low-dimensional subspaces. To compress\nthese noisy token representations, an associated denoising operation naturally\ntakes the form of a multi-head (subspace) self-attention. By unrolling such\niterative denoising operations into a deep network, we arrive at a highly\ncompact architecture that consists of \\textit{only} self-attention operators\nwith skip connections at each layer. Moreover, we show that each layer performs\nhighly efficient denoising: it improves the signal-to-noise ratio of token\nrepresentations \\textit{at a linear rate} with respect to the number of layers.\nDespite its simplicity, extensive experiments on vision and language tasks\ndemonstrate that such a transformer achieves performance close to that of\nstandard transformer architectures such as GPT-2 and CRATE.",

    "summary": "Pre-trained Transformer-based neural language models, such as BERT, have\nachieved remarkable results on varieties of NLP tasks. Recent works have shown\nthat attention-based models can benefit from more focused attention over local\nregions. Most of them restrict the attention scope within a linear span, or\nconfine to certain tasks such as machine translation and question answering. In\nthis paper, we propose a syntax-aware local attention, where the attention\nscopes are restrained based on the distances in the syntactic structure. The\nproposed syntax-aware local attention can be integrated with pretrained\nlanguage models, such as BERT, to render the model to focus on syntactically\nrelevant words. We conduct experiments on various single-sentence benchmarks,\nincluding sentence classification and sequence labeling tasks. Experimental\nresults show consistent gains over BERT on all benchmark datasets. The\nextensive studies verify that our model achieves better performance owing to\nmore focused attention over syntactically relevant words.",

We present VARS, Visual Attention from Recurrent\nSparse reconstruction, a new attention formulation built on two prominent\nfeatures of the human visual attention mechanism: recurrency and sparsity.\nRelated features are grouped together via recurrent connections between\nneurons, with salient objects emerging via sparse regularization. VARS adopts\nan attractor network with recurrent connections that converges toward a stable\npattern over time. Network layers are represented as ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs), formulating attention as a recurrent attractor network that\nequivalently optimizes the sparse reconstruction of input using a dictionary of\n\"templates\" encoding underlying patterns of data.

We show that, for\nsome UD relation types, there exist heads that can recover the dependency type\nsignificantly better than baselines on parsed English text, suggesting that\nsome self-attention heads act as a proxy for syntactic structure.

    "title": "Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling",
    "summary": "Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise\nattention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention\ngranularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image\npixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher\nlevels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by\nadapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of\nConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we\nlearn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in\na given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively\ndetermined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with\nvarying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive,\nachieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly\nreduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged\ninto transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance\nusing less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent\nworks with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also\napplicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.",

Attention is typically multi-headed, where each head has an\nindependent set of learned parameters and operates on the same input feature\nsequence. The output of multi-headed attention is a fusion of the outputs from\nthe individual heads. We empirically analyze the diversity between\nrepresentations produced by the different attention heads and demonstrate that\nthe heads become highly correlated during the course of training. We\ninvestigate a few approaches to increasing attention head diversity, including\nusing different attention mechanisms for each head and auxiliary training loss\nfunctions to promote head diversity. We show that introducing\ndiversity-promoting auxiliary loss functions during training is a more\neffective approach, and obtain WER improvements of up to 6% relative on the\nLibrispeech corpus.

In the field of cognitive modeling, such attention\npatterns have recently been interpreted as embodying the process of cue-based\nretrieval, in which attention over multiple targets is taken to generate\ninterference and latency during retrieval. Under this framework, this work\nfirst defines an entropy-based predictor that quantifies the diffuseness of\nself-attention, as well as distance-based predictors that capture the\nincremental change in attention patterns across timesteps. Moreover, following\nrecent studies that question the informativeness of attention weights, we also\nexperiment with alternative methods for incorporating vector norms into\nattention weights. Regression experiments using predictors calculated from the\nGPT-2 language model show that these predictors deliver a substantially better\nfit to held-out self-paced reading and eye-tracking data over a rigorous\nbaseline including GPT-2 surprisal. Additionally, the distance-based predictors\ngenerally demonstrated higher predictive power, with effect sizes of up to 6.59\nms per standard deviation on self-paced reading times (compared to 2.82 ms for\nsurprisal) and 1.05 ms per standard deviation on eye-gaze durations (compared\nto 3.81 ms for surprisal).",

Drawing inspiration from keypoint selection processes, we propose to\nfirst classify all pixels into two categories: matchable and non-matchable.\nMatchable pixels are expected to receive higher attention weights, while\nnon-matchable ones are down-weighted. In this work, we propose a novel\nattention reweighting mechanism that simultaneously incorporates a learnable\nbias term into the attention logits and applies a matchability-informed\nrescaling to the input value features. The bias term, injected prior to the\nsoftmax operation, selectively adjusts attention scores based on the confidence\nof query-key interactions. Concurrently, the feature rescaling acts\npost-attention by modulating the influence of each value vector in the final\noutput. This dual design allows the attention mechanism to dynamically adjust\nboth its internal weighting scheme and the magnitude of its output\nrepresentations.

We revisit linear attention through a\nprediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a\ncombination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which\ncreates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce\nResidual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with\nan explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent\nstate that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base\nprediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net\n(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced\ncorrection control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized\nlinear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language\nmodeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform\ntheir respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing\nthe gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.",

    "summary": "The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their\ndot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design\nprinciples: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token\ninteractions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to\neach input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus\nsoftmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states\n(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of\nthese principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically\ndeconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax\nthese principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid\narchitectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical\nanalysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their\nabsence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical\nform and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when\npreserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in\nisolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard\nattention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our\nunderstanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new\navenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.",

The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention,\nperforms the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local\nattention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two\nnetwork regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well\nas weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across\nchannels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local\nwindow. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared\nacross channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the\nconnection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.\nWe point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its\ndynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight\nsharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)\nacross spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on\ndepth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation\ncomplexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin\nTransformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet\nclassification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation.

The\nexisting works treat the temporal axis as a simple extension of spatial axes,\nfocusing on shortening the spatio-temporal sequence by either generic pooling\nor local windowing without utilizing temporal redundancy.\n  However, videos naturally contain redundant information between neighboring\nframes; thereby, we could potentially suppress attention on visually similar\nframes in a dilated manner. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the LAPS, a\nlong-term ``\\textbf{\\textit{Leap Attention}}'' (LA), short-term\n``\\textbf{\\textit{Periodic Shift}}'' (\\textit{P}-Shift) module for video\ntransformers, with $(2TN^2)$ complexity.

Our goal is to explore how a\none-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear\nlayer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training\ndynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a\none-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating\nChain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer\nwell-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer\ntransformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of\nattention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase,\nthe attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable\nvectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the\nlinear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin\nhyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive\nand negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$.

    "summary": "Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful\nTransformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple\nparallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two\nfundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a\nset via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant\nfeatures from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard\nattention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this\nwork, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially:\n(a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder\ngeneralization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention\nmechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head\nstructure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and\ncomposes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an\nadditional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value\npairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms\nstandard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some\nout-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate\nthat Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type\nof retrieval needed.

Despite its empirical success, few studies have examined its\nstatistical underpinnings: What statistical model is bidirectional attention\nimplicitly fitting? What sets it apart from its non-attention predecessors? We\nexplore these questions in this paper. The key observation is that fitting a\nsingle-layer single-head bidirectional attention, upon reparameterization, is\nequivalent to fitting a continuous bag of words (CBOW) model with\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) weights. Further, bidirectional attention with\nmultiple heads and multiple layers is equivalent to stacked MoEs and a mixture\nof MoEs, respectively. This statistical viewpoint reveals the distinct use of\nMoE in bidirectional attention, which aligns with its practical effectiveness\nin handling heterogeneous data. It also suggests an immediate extension to\ncategorical tabular data, if we view each word location in a sentence as a\ntabular feature. Across empirical studies, we find that this extension\noutperforms existing tabular extensions of transformers in out-of-distribution\n(OOD) generalization. Finally, this statistical perspective of bidirectional\nattention enables us to theoretically characterize when linear word analogies\nare present in its word embeddings. These analyses show that bidirectional\nattention can require much stronger assumptions to exhibit linear word\nanalogies than its non-attention predecessors.",

    "summary": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) \"see\" images by leveraging the attention\nmechanism between text and visual tokens in the transformer decoder. Ideally,\nthese models should focus on key visual information relevant to the text token.\nHowever, recent findings indicate that LMMs have an extraordinary tendency to\nconsistently allocate high attention weights to specific visual tokens, even\nwhen these tokens are irrelevant to the corresponding text. In this study, we\ninvestigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual\ntokens and examine their characteristics. Our findings show that this behavior\narises due to the massive activation of certain hidden state dimensions, which\nresembles the attention sink found in language models. Hence, we refer to this\nphenomenon as the visual attention sink. In particular, our analysis reveals\nthat removing the irrelevant visual sink tokens does not impact model\nperformance, despite receiving high attention weights. Consequently, we recycle\nthe attention to these tokens as surplus resources, redistributing the\nattention budget to enhance focus on the image. To achieve this, we introduce\nVisual Attention Redistribution (VAR), a method that redistributes attention in\nimage-centric heads, which we identify as innately focusing on visual\ninformation. VAR can be seamlessly applied across different LMMs to improve\nperformance on a wide range of tasks, including general vision-language tasks,\nvisual hallucination tasks, and vision-centric tasks, all without the need for\nadditional training, models, or inference steps. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that VAR enables LMMs to process visual information more\neffectively by adjusting their internal attention mechanisms, offering a new\ndirection to enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LMMs.",

    "summary": "Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.\nHowever, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism\nposes a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large\nbody of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention\nas a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve\nlinear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention\nmechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can\nover-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.\nEnforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token\nparticipation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention\nmechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.\nWe propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously\nlinear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between\nattention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The\ncentral idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning\nit on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two\nentropic optimal transport problems (queries $\\to$ pivot and pivot $\\to$ keys)\nand compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention\nmatrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \\ll n$, and\napplies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \\times n$ map.\nThe pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end.

Prior\nworks such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)\nshrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill\nand training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional\nAttention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,\nand values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent\nspace. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all\nat once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to\nhead-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query\nAttention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier\nso that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without\nsacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both\nGQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.\nAdditionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE\nmodels with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache\ncompression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA\nalso dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to\nsubstantially faster training and prefill than existing methods.

The\nkey factor for the outstanding performance of self-attention models is their\nability to capture temporal relationships without being limited by the distance\nbetween two related events. However, we note that the range of the learned\ncontext progressively increases from the lower to upper self-attention layers,\nwhilst acoustic events often happen within short time spans in a left-to-right\norder. This leads to a question: for speech recognition, is a global view of\nthe entire sequence still important for the upper self-attention layers in the\nencoder of Transformers? To investigate this, we replace these self-attention\nlayers with feed forward layers. In our speech recognition experiments (Wall\nStreet Journal and Switchboard), we indeed observe an interesting result:\nreplacing the upper self-attention layers in the encoder with feed forward\nlayers leads to no performance drop, and even minor gains. Our experiments\noffer insights to how self-attention layers process the speech signal, leading\nto the conclusion that the lower self-attention layers of the encoder encode a\nsufficiently wide range of inputs, hence learning further contextual\ninformation in the upper layers is unnecessary.",

To this end, previous methods explore\ndifferent attention patterns by limiting a fixed number of spatially nearby\ntokens to accelerate the ViT's multi-head self-attention (MHSA) operations.\nHowever, such structured attention patterns limit the token-to-token\nconnections to their spatial relevance, which disregards learned semantic\nconnections from a full attention mask. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach to learn instance-dependent attention patterns, by devising a\nlightweight connectivity predictor module to estimate the connectivity score of\neach pair of tokens. Intuitively, two tokens have high connectivity scores if\nthe features are considered relevant either spatially or semantically. As each\ntoken only attends to a small number of other tokens, the binarized\nconnectivity masks are often very sparse by nature and therefore provide the\nopportunity to accelerate the network via sparse computations. Equipped with\nthe learned unstructured attention pattern, sparse attention ViT (Sparsifiner)\nproduces a superior Pareto-optimal trade-off between FLOPs and top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet compared to token sparsity.

    "summary": "As its core computation, a self-attention mechanism gauges pairwise\ncorrelations across the entire input sequence. Despite favorable performance,\ncalculating pairwise correlations is prohibitively costly. While recent work\nhas shown the benefits of runtime pruning of elements with low attention\nscores, the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms and their on-chip\nmemory capacity demands are overlooked. This work addresses these constraints\nby architecting an accelerator, called SPRINT, which leverages the inherent\nparallelism of ReRAM crossbar arrays to compute attention scores in an\napproximate manner. Our design prunes the low attention scores using a\nlightweight analog thresholding circuitry within ReRAM, enabling SPRINT to\nfetch only a small subset of relevant data to on-chip memory. To mitigate\npotential negative repercussions for model accuracy, SPRINT re-computes the\nattention scores for the few fetched data in digital. The combined in-memory\npruning and on-chip recompute of the relevant attention scores enables SPRINT\nto transform quadratic complexity to a merely linear one. In addition, we\nidentify and leverage a dynamic spatial locality between the adjacent attention\noperations even after pruning, which eliminates costly yet redundant data\nfetches. We evaluate our proposed technique on a wide range of state-of-the-art\ntransformer models. On average, SPRINT yields 7.5x speedup and 19.6x energy\nreduction when total 16KB on-chip memory is used, while virtually on par with\niso-accuracy of the baseline models (on average 0.36% degradation).",

    "summary": "The recently proposed data augmentation TransMix employs attention labels to\nhelp visual transformers (ViT) achieve better robustness and performance.\nHowever, TransMix is deficient in two aspects: 1) The image cropping method of\nTransMix may not be suitable for ViTs. 2) At the early stage of training, the\nmodel produces unreliable attention maps. TransMix uses unreliable attention\nmaps to compute mixed attention labels that can affect the model. To address\nthe aforementioned issues, we propose MaskMix and Progressive Attention\nLabeling (PAL) in image and label space, respectively. In detail, from the\nperspective of image space, we design MaskMix, which mixes two images based on\na patch-like grid mask. In particular, the size of each mask patch is\nadjustable and is a multiple of the image patch size, which ensures each image\npatch comes from only one image and contains more global contents. From the\nperspective of label space, we design PAL, which utilizes a progressive factor\nto dynamically re-weight the attention weights of the mixed attention label.\nFinally, we combine MaskMix and Progressive Attention Labeling as our new data\naugmentation method, named MixPro. The experimental results show that our\nmethod can improve various ViT-based models at scales on ImageNet\nclassification (73.8\\% top-1 accuracy based on DeiT-T for 300 epochs). After\nbeing pre-trained with MixPro on ImageNet, the ViT-based models also\ndemonstrate better transferability to semantic segmentation, object detection,\nand instance segmentation. Furthermore, compared to TransMix, MixPro also shows\nstronger robustness on several benchmarks. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/fistyee/MixPro.",

    "title": "Longer Attention Span: Increasing Transformer Context Length with Sparse\n  Graph Processing Techniques",
    "summary": "Transformers have demonstrated great success in numerous domains including\nnatural language processing and bioinformatics. This success stems from the use\nof the attention mechanism by these models in order to represent and propagate\npairwise interactions between individual tokens of sequential data. However,\nthe primary limitation of this operation is its quadratic memory and time\ncomplexity in relation to the input's context length - the length of a sequence\nover which the interactions need to be captured. This significantly limits the\nlength of sequences that can be inferred upon by these models. Extensive\nresearch has been conducted to reduce the number of pairwise interactions to\nsub-quadratic in relation to the context length by introducing sparsity into\nthe attention mechanism through the development of sparse attention masks.\nHowever, efficient implementations that achieve \"true sparsity\" are lacking.\n  In this work, we address this issue by proposing a graph computing view of\nattention where tokens are perceived as nodes of the graph and the attention\nmask determines the edges of the graph. Using this view, we develop graph\nprocessing algorithms to implement the attention mechanism. Both theoretically\nand empirically, we demonstrate that our algorithms only perform the needed\ncomputations, i.e., they are work optimal. We also perform extensive\nexperimentation using popular attention masks to explore the impact of sparsity\non execution time and achievable context length. Our experiments demonstrate\nsignificant speedups in execution times compared to state-of-the-art attention\nimplementations such as FlashAttention for large sequence lengths. We also\ndemonstrate that our algorithms are able to achieve extremely long sequence\nlengths of as high as 160 million on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (SXM4 80GB).",

    "summary": "We introduce Vision-Language Attention Distillation (Vi-LAD), a novel\napproach for distilling socially compliant navigation knowledge from a large\nVision-Language Model (VLM) into a lightweight transformer model for real-time\nrobotic navigation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on expert\ndemonstrations or human-annotated datasets, Vi-LAD performs knowledge\ndistillation and fine-tuning at the intermediate layer representation level\n(i.e., attention maps) by leveraging the backbone of a pre-trained\nvision-action model. These attention maps highlight key navigational regions in\na given scene, which serve as implicit guidance for socially aware motion\nplanning. Vi-LAD fine-tunes a transformer-based model using intermediate\nattention maps extracted from the pre-trained vision-action model, combined\nwith attention-like semantic maps constructed from a large VLM. To achieve\nthis, we introduce a novel attention-level distillation loss that fuses\nknowledge from both sources, generating augmented attention maps with enhanced\nsocial awareness. These refined attention maps are then utilized as a\ntraversability costmap within a socially aware model predictive controller\n(MPC) for navigation. We validate our approach through real-world experiments\non a Husky wheeled robot, demonstrating significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) navigation methods.

    "summary": "Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,\nprompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden\nstates. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,\nleading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.\nDespite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention\ncomponent has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various\nlinear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced\ngating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this\ncomprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M\nparameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six\nlinear attention variants across five hybridization ratios.

To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which\ncomputes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While\neffective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for\nhigh-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated\nNeighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its\nsuccess in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local\nprecision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,\neffectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,\nour preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local\ndesign to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,\nprimarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local\nattention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that\ncomplements local attention, effectively integrating global context without\nsacrificing pixel-level precision.

    "summary": "The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical\nchallenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing\nultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and\nfixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal\nredundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion\ntransformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit\nstructured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads\ndynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,\ncross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods\neither impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting\ntheir effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a\nhardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive\ntiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via\ndynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity\nlevels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search\nalgorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention\npathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on\nsingle-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with\nfull-attention baselines.

However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA\nwith respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,\nparticularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,\nsuch as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have\neffectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates\nautoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While\nhighly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,\nwhich remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.\nThis paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention\narchitecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.\nInstead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.\nThis architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity\nof the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query\nheads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical\nfoundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural\nvariants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate\nthat SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in\ncomputation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and\nencoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary\nsmallscale experiments.

However, the application of\nTransformers in computer-aided design (CAD), particularly for processing\nboundary representation (B-rep) models, remains largely unexplored. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a novel approach for adapting Transformers to B-rep\nlearning, called the Boundary Representation Transformer (BRT). B-rep models\npose unique challenges due to their irregular topology and continuous geometric\ndefinitions, which are fundamentally different from the structured and discrete\ndata Transformers are designed for. To address this, BRT proposes a continuous\ngeometric embedding method that encodes B-rep surfaces (trimmed and untrimmed)\ninto Bezier triangles, preserving their shape and continuity without\ndiscretization. Additionally, BRT employs a topology-aware embedding method\nthat organizes these geometric embeddings into a sequence of discrete tokens\nsuitable for Transformers, capturing both geometric and topological\ncharacteristics within B-rep models. This enables the Transformer's attention\nmechanism to effectively learn shape patterns and contextual semantics of\nboundary elements in a B-rep model.

    "summary": "This paper analyzes three formal models of Transformer encoders that differ\nin the form of their self-attention mechanism: unique hard attention (UHAT);\ngeneralized unique hard attention (GUHAT), which generalizes UHAT; and\naveraging hard attention (AHAT). We show that UHAT and GUHAT Transformers,\nviewed as string acceptors, can only recognize formal languages in the\ncomplexity class AC$^0$, the class of languages recognizable by families of\nBoolean circuits of constant depth and polynomial size. This upper bound\nsubsumes Hahn's (2020) results that GUHAT cannot recognize the DYCK languages\nor the PARITY language, since those languages are outside AC$^0$ (Furst et al.,\n1984). In contrast, the non-AC$^0$ languages MAJORITY and DYCK-1 are\nrecognizable by AHAT networks, implying that AHAT can recognize languages that\nUHAT and GUHAT cannot.",

    "summary": "Since 2017, the Transformer-based models play critical roles in various\ndownstream Natural Language Processing tasks. However, a common limitation of\nthe attention mechanism utilized in Transformer Encoder is that it cannot\nautomatically capture the information of word order, so explicit position\nembeddings are generally required to be fed into the target model. In contrast,\nTransformer Decoder with the causal attention masks is naturally sensitive to\nthe word order. In this work, we focus on improving the position encoding\nability of BERT with the causal attention masks. Furthermore, we propose a new\npre-trained language model DecBERT and evaluate it on the GLUE benchmark.\nExperimental results show that (1) the causal attention mask is effective for\nBERT on the language understanding tasks; (2) our DecBERT model without\nposition embeddings achieve comparable performance on the GLUE benchmark; and\n(3) our modification accelerates the pre-training process and DecBERT w/ PE\nachieves better overall performance than the baseline systems when pre-training\nwith the same amount of computational resources.",

The correlation operation is a simple\nfusion manner to consider the similarity between the template and the search\nregion.

Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as\ncompared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency\nbottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in\ntransformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the\nnumber of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations\n(e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention,\nimpacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a\nseparable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple\nyet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses\nelement-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice\nfor resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is\nstate-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object\nclassification and MS-COCO object detection.

    "title": "Beyond Attentive Tokens: Incorporating Token Importance and Diversity\n  for Efficient Vision Transformers",
    "summary": "Vision transformers have achieved significant improvements on various vision\ntasks but their quadratic interactions between tokens significantly reduce\ncomputational efficiency. Many pruning methods have been proposed to remove\nredundant tokens for efficient vision transformers recently. However, existing\nstudies mainly focus on the token importance to preserve local attentive tokens\nbut completely ignore the global token diversity. In this paper, we emphasize\nthe cruciality of diverse global semantics and propose an efficient token\ndecoupling and merging method that can jointly consider the token importance\nand diversity for token pruning. According to the class token attention, we\ndecouple the attentive and inattentive tokens. In addition to preserving the\nmost discriminative local tokens, we merge similar inattentive tokens and match\nhomogeneous attentive tokens to maximize the token diversity. Despite its\nsimplicity, our method obtains a promising trade-off between model complexity\nand classification accuracy. On DeiT-S, our method reduces the FLOPs by 35%\nwith only a 0.2% accuracy drop. Notably, benefiting from maintaining the token\ndiversity, our method can even improve the accuracy of DeiT-T by 0.1% after\nreducing its FLOPs by 40%.",

The\nsecond network takes this residual image as input and passes it through\nconvolution layers before superposing it on the generated feature maps. It is\nthen passed through global context and depth-aware transformer encoders to\nobtain channel attention.

Second, RPE-based Transformers are not universal\napproximators due to their limited capacity at encoding absolute positional\ninformation, which limits their application in position-critical tasks. In this\nwork, we propose StableMask: a parameter-free method to address both\nlimitations by refining the causal mask.

TReX optimally chooses the transformer\nencoders for attention reuse to achieve near iso-accuracy performance while\nmeeting the user-specified delay requirement. Based on our analysis on the\nImagenet-1k dataset, we find that TReX achieves 2.3x (2.19x) EDAP reduction and\n1.86x (1.79x) TOPS/mm2 improvement with ~1% accuracy drop in case of DeiT-S\n(LV-ViT-S) ViT models. Additionally, TReX achieves high accuracy at high EDAP\nreduction compared to state-of-the-art token pruning and weight sharing\napproaches. On NLP tasks such as CoLA, TReX leads to 2% higher non-ideal\naccuracy compared to baseline at 1.6x lower EDAP.",

    "summary": "With the achievements of Transformer in the field of natural language\nprocessing, the encoder-decoder and the attention mechanism in Transformer have\nbeen applied to computer vision. Recently, in multiple tasks of computer vision\n(image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, etc.),\nstate-of-the-art convolutional neural networks have introduced some concepts of\nTransformer. This proves that Transformer has a good prospect in the field of\nimage recognition. After Vision Transformer was proposed, more and more works\nbegan to use self-attention to completely replace the convolutional layer. This\nwork is based on Vision Transformer, combined with the pyramid architecture,\nusing Split-transform-merge to propose the group encoder and name the network\narchitecture Aggregated Pyramid Vision Transformer (APVT). We perform image\nclassification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset and object detection tasks on the\nCOCO 2017 dataset. Compared with other network architectures that use\nTransformer as the backbone, APVT has excellent results while reducing the\ncomputational cost. We hope this improved strategy can provide a reference for\nfuture Transformer research in computer vision.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce DropHead, a structured dropout method\nspecifically designed for regularizing the multi-head attention mechanism,\nwhich is a key component of transformer, a state-of-the-art model for various\nNLP tasks. In contrast to the conventional dropout mechanisms which randomly\ndrop units or connections, the proposed DropHead is a structured dropout\nmethod. It drops entire attention-heads during training and It prevents the\nmulti-head attention model from being dominated by a small portion of attention\nheads while also reduces the risk of overfitting the training data, thus making\nuse of the multi-head attention mechanism more efficiently. Motivated by recent\nstudies about the learning dynamic of the multi-head attention mechanism, we\npropose a specific dropout rate schedule to adaptively adjust the dropout rate\nof DropHead and achieve better regularization effect. Experimental results on\nboth machine translation and text classification benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "summary": "Transformer models have become a promising approach for crop-type\nclassification. Although their attention weights can be used to understand the\nrelevant time points for crop disambiguation, the validity of these insights\ndepends on how closely the attention weights approximate the actual workings of\nthese black-box models, which is not always clear. In this paper, we introduce\na novel explainability framework that systematically evaluates the explanatory\npower of the attention weights of a standard transformer encoder for crop-type\nclassification. Our results show that attention patterns strongly relate to key\ndates, which are often associated with critical phenological events for\ncrop-type classification. Further, the sensitivity analysis reveals the limited\ncapability of the attention weights to characterize crop phenology as the\nidentified phenological events depend on the other crops considered during\ntraining. This limitation highlights the relevance of future work towards the\ndevelopment of deep learning approaches capable of automatically learning the\ntemporal vegetation dynamics for accurate crop disambiguation",

However, the self-attention module highly\nrelies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among\nquery-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product\nmultiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the\nvisual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the\nscale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy\nthe internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,\nthis paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,\nSynthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor\nfeatures. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among\nquery-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to\nlearn the synthetic attention weight from visual information.

    "summary": "Social media has a significant impact on people's lives. Hate speech on\nsocial media has emerged as one of society's most serious issues in recent\nyears. Text and pictures are two forms of multimodal data that are distributed\nwithin articles. Unimodal analysis has been the primary emphasis of earlier\napproaches. Additionally, when doing multimodal analysis, researchers neglect\nto preserve the distinctive qualities associated with each modality. To address\nthese shortcomings, the present article suggests a scalable architecture for\nmultimodal hate content detection called transformer-based multilevel attention\n(STMA). This architecture consists of three main parts: a combined\nattention-based deep learning mechanism, a vision attention-mechanism encoder,\nand a caption attention-mechanism encoder. To identify hate content, each\ncomponent uses various attention processes and handles multimodal data in a\nunique way. Several studies employing multiple assessment criteria on three\nhate speech datasets such as Hateful memes, MultiOff, and MMHS150K, validate\nthe suggested architecture's efficacy. The outcomes demonstrate that on all\nthree datasets, the suggested strategy performs better than the baseline\napproaches.",

    "summary": "Transformers are one of the most successful architectures of modern neural\nnetworks. At their core there is the so-called attention mechanism, which\nrecently interested the physics community as it can be written as the\nderivative of an energy function in certain cases: while it is possible to\nwrite the cross-attention layer as a modern Hopfield network, the same is not\npossible for the self-attention, which is used in the GPT architectures and\nother autoregressive models. In this work we show that it is possible to obtain\nthe self-attention layer as the derivative of local energy terms, which\nresemble a pseudo-likelihood. We leverage the analogy with pseudo-likelihood to\ndesign a recurrent model that can be trained without backpropagation: the\ndynamics shows transient states that are strongly correlated with both train\nand test examples. Overall we present a novel framework to interpret\nself-attention as an attractor network, potentially paving the way for new\ntheoretical approaches inspired from physics to understand transformers.",

Here, we introduce two new\naspects in PS-Former: 1) a learnable condensation layer that performs point\ndownsampling and feature extraction; and 2) a Position-to-Structure Attention\nmechanism that recursively enriches the structural information with the\nposition attention branch. Compared with the competing methods, while being\ngeneric with less heuristics feature designs, PS-Former demonstrates\ncompetitive experimental results on three 3D point cloud tasks including\nclassification, part segmentation, and scene segmentation.",

    "summary": "In action recognition, although the combination of spatio-temporal videos and\nskeleton features can improve the recognition performance, a separate model and\nbalancing feature representation for cross-modal data are required. To solve\nthese problems, we propose Spatio-TemporAl cRoss (STAR)-transformer, which can\neffectively represent two cross-modal features as a recognizable vector. First,\nfrom the input video and skeleton sequence, video frames are output as global\ngrid tokens and skeletons are output as joint map tokens, respectively. These\ntokens are then aggregated into multi-class tokens and input into\nSTAR-transformer. The STAR-transformer encoder layer consists of a full\nself-attention (FAttn) module and a proposed zigzag spatio-temporal attention\n(ZAttn) module. Similarly, the continuous decoder consists of a FAttn module\nand a proposed binary spatio-temporal attention (BAttn) module.\nSTAR-transformer learns an efficient multi-feature representation of the\nspatio-temporal features by properly arranging pairings of the FAttn, ZAttn,\nand BAttn modules. Experimental results on the Penn-Action, NTU RGB+D 60, and\n120 datasets show that the proposed method achieves a promising improvement in\nperformance in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods.",

However, the success is limited to small-scale graphs due to\nthe drawbacks of full dot-product attention on graphs such as the quadratic\ncomplexity with respect to the number of nodes and message aggregation from\nenormous irrelevant nodes. To address these issues, we propose Deformable Graph\nTransformer (DGT) that performs sparse attention via dynamically sampled\nrelevant nodes for efficiently handling large-scale graphs with a linear\ncomplexity in the number of nodes. Specifically, our framework first constructs\nmultiple node sequences with various criteria to consider both structural and\nsemantic proximity. Then, combining with our learnable Katz Positional\nEncodings, the sparse attention is applied to the node sequences for learning\nnode representations with a significantly reduced computational cost. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our DGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7\ngraph benchmark datasets with 2.5 - 449 times less computational cost compared\nto transformer-based graph models with full attention.",

When Transformer emits a non-literal translation - i.e.\nidentifies the expression as idiomatic - the encoder processes idioms more\nstrongly as single lexical units compared to literal expressions. This\nmanifests in idioms' parts being grouped through attention and in reduced\ninteraction between idioms and their context.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the\nattention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are\nexisting attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they\nhave limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to\nTransformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences,\nbut they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information.

    "summary": "The Transformer has emerged as a versatile and effective architecture with\nbroad applications. However, it still remains an open problem how to\nefficiently train a Transformer model of high utility with differential privacy\nguarantees. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in learning\ndifferentially private Transformers, i.e., heavy computation overhead due to\nper-sample gradient clipping and unintentional attention distraction within the\nattention mechanism. In response, we propose DPFormer, equipped with Phantom\nClipping and Re-Attention Mechanism, to address these challenges. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that DPFormer can reduce computational costs during\ngradient clipping and effectively mitigate attention distraction (which could\nobstruct the training process and lead to a significant performance drop,\nespecially in the presence of long-tailed data). Such analysis is further\ncorroborated by empirical results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DPFormer.",

Transformer LMs\nwith Pushdown Layers are syntactic language models that autoregressively and\nsynchronously update this stack tape as they predict new tokens, in turn using\nthe stack tape to softly modulate attention over tokens -- for instance,\nlearning to \"skip\" over closed constituents. When trained on a corpus of\nstrings annotated with silver constituency parses, Transformers equipped with\nPushdown Layers achieve dramatically better and 3-5x more sample-efficient\nsyntactic generalization, while maintaining similar perplexities.

    "summary": "The transformer architecture has catalyzed revolutionary advances in language\nmodeling. However, recent architectural recipes, such as state-space models,\nhave bridged the performance gap. Motivated by this, we examine the benefits of\nConvolution-Augmented Transformer (CAT) for recall, copying, and length\ngeneralization tasks. CAT incorporates convolutional filters in the K/Q/V\nembeddings of an attention layer. Through CAT, we show that the locality of the\nconvolution synergizes with the global view of the attention. Unlike comparable\narchitectures, such as Mamba or transformer, CAT can provably solve the\nassociative recall (AR) and copying tasks using a single layer while also\nenjoying guaranteed length generalization. We also establish computational\ntradeoffs between convolution and attention by characterizing how convolution\ncan mitigate the need for full attention by summarizing the context window and\ncreating salient summary tokens to attend. Evaluations on real datasets\ncorroborate our findings and demonstrate that CAT and its variations indeed\nenhance the language modeling performance.",

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL.

    "title": "Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy\n  Collapse",
    "summary": "Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we\ninvestigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of\nthe attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each\nattention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model\nsharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and\ntasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability,\nwhich can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the\npathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated\nattention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose\n$\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all\nlinear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We\ndemonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the\nattention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a\ntight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast\nwith the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation\nfor our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image\nclassification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech\nrecognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides\nstability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going\nso far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive\nperformance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive\noptimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech\nrecognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.\nCode is available at \\url{https://github.com/apple/ml-sigma-reparam}.",

    "summary": "Vision Transformers have attracted a lot of attention recently since the\nsuccessful implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) on vision tasks. With\nvision Transformers, specifically the multi-head self-attention modules,\nnetworks can capture long-term dependencies inherently. However, these\nattention modules normally need to be trained on large datasets, and vision\nTransformers show inferior performance on small datasets when training from\nscratch compared with widely dominant backbones like ResNets. Note that the\nTransformer model was first proposed for natural language processing, which\ncarries denser information than natural images. To boost the performance of\nvision Transformers on small datasets, this paper proposes to explicitly\nincrease the input information density in the frequency domain. Specifically,\nwe introduce selecting channels by calculating the channel-wise heatmaps in the\nfrequency domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), reducing the size of\ninput while keeping most information and hence increasing the information\ndensity. As a result, 25% fewer channels are kept while better performance is\nachieved compared with previous work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach on five small-scale datasets, including\nCIFAR-10/100, SVHN, Flowers-102, and Tiny ImageNet.

In the current work, we propose an\nencoder-decoder architecture using LSTMs which generates smoother predicted\narticulatory trajectories. For modeling duration variations across speaking\nrates, we deploy attention network, which eliminates the needto align\ntrajectories in different rates using DTW. We performa phoneme specific\nduration analysis to examine how well duration is transformed using the\nproposed AstNet. As the range of articulatory motions is correlated with\nspeaking rate, we also analyze amplitude of the transformed articulatory\nmovements at different rates compared to their original counterparts, to\nexamine how well the proposed AstNet predicts the extent of articulatory\nmovements in N2F and N2S.

Recently, Transformer has demonstrated promising performance on\nmany 2D and even 3D vision tasks.

However, Transformer only performs a\nsimple sum on the point features, based on the self-attention mechanism, and\nall the points share the same transformation for value. Such isotropic\noperation lacks the ability to capture the direction-distance-oriented local\nstructure which is important for 3D object detection. In this work, we propose\na Structure-Embedding transFormer (SEFormer), which can not only preserve local\nstructure as traditional Transformer but also have the ability to encode the\nlocal structure.

    "summary": "Transformers are crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations,\nparticularly in supporting the integration of renewable energy. Effective\nmonitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and\nperformance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which\nis generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST\nmeasurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements.\nExisting HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing\nworst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for\ntransformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages\nphysics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural\nNetworks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to\nimprove prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The\ncomputational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation\nof the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN\nmodel convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive\nattention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first\ntime, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate\nspatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE\nnumerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the\nspatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports\ntransformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a\ndistribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.",

    "summary": "Hyperbolic geometry have shown significant potential in modeling complex\nstructured data, particularly those with underlying tree-like and hierarchical\nstructures. Despite the impressive performance of various hyperbolic neural\nnetworks across numerous domains, research on adapting the Transformer to\nhyperbolic space remains limited. Previous attempts have mainly focused on\nmodifying self-attention modules in the Transformer. However, these efforts\nhave fallen short of developing a complete hyperbolic Transformer. This stems\nprimarily from: (i) the absence of well-defined modules in hyperbolic space,\nincluding linear transformation layers, LayerNorm layers, activation functions,\ndropout operations, etc. (ii) the quadratic time complexity of the existing\nhyperbolic self-attention module w.r.t the number of input tokens, which\nhinders its scalability. To address these challenges, we propose, Hypformer, a\nnovel hyperbolic Transformer based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry.\nIn Hypformer, we introduce two foundational blocks that define the essential\nmodules of the Transformer in hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we develop a\nlinear self-attention mechanism in hyperbolic space, enabling hyperbolic\nTransformer to process billion-scale graph data and long-sequence inputs for\nthe first time.

    "summary": "The intriguing in-context learning (ICL) abilities of deep Transformer models\nhave lately garnered significant attention. By studying in-context linear\nregression on unimodal Gaussian data, recent empirical and theoretical works\nhave argued that ICL emerges from Transformers' abilities to simulate learning\nalgorithms like gradient descent. However, these works fail to capture the\nremarkable ability of Transformers to learn multiple tasks in context. To this\nend, we study in-context learning for linear regression with diverse tasks,\ncharacterized by data covariance matrices with condition numbers ranging from\n$[1, \\kappa]$, and highlight the importance of depth in this setting. More\nspecifically, (a) we show theoretical lower bounds of $\\log(\\kappa)$ (or\n$\\sqrt{\\kappa}$) linear attention layers in the unrestricted (or restricted)\nattention setting and, (b) we show that multilayer Transformers can indeed\nsolve such tasks with a number of layers that matches the lower bounds.\nHowever, we show that this expressivity of multilayer Transformer comes at the\nprice of robustness. In particular, multilayer Transformers are not robust to\neven distributional shifts as small as $O(e^{-L})$ in Wasserstein distance,\nwhere $L$ is the depth of the network. We then demonstrate that Looped\nTransformers -- a special class of multilayer Transformers with weight-sharing\n-- not only exhibit similar expressive power but are also provably robust under\nmild assumptions. Besides out-of-distribution generalization, we also show that\nLooped Transformers are the only models that exhibit a monotonic behavior of\nloss with respect to depth.",

While multi-scale and long-range spatial\ncorrelations are essential in unmixing tasks, current Transformer-based\nunmixing networks, built on Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin-Transformer,\nstruggle to capture them effectively. Additionally, current Transformer-based\nunmixing networks rely on the linear mixing model, which lacks the flexibility\nto accommodate scenarios where nonlinear effects are significant. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a multi-scale Dilated Transformer-based unmixing\nnetwork for nonlinear HU (DTU-Net). The encoder employs two branches. The first\none performs multi-scale spatial feature extraction using Multi-Scale Dilated\nAttention (MSDA) in the Dilated Transformer, which varies dilation rates across\nattention heads to capture long-range and multi-scale spatial correlations. The\nsecond one performs spectral feature extraction utilizing 3D-CNNs with channel\nattention. The outputs from both branches are then fused to integrate\nmulti-scale spatial and spectral information, which is subsequently transformed\nto estimate the abundances. The decoder is designed to accommodate both linear\nand nonlinear mixing scenarios. Its interpretability is enhanced by explicitly\nmodeling the relationships between endmembers, abundances, and nonlinear\ncoefficients in accordance with the polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model\n(PPNMM).

These divergences hinder the easy adoption of training advances for\nTransformers developed in other domains. Contrary to previous GTs, this work\ndemonstrates that the plain Transformer architecture can be a powerful graph\nlearner. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate three simple, minimal, and\neasy-to-implement modifications to the plain Transformer architecture to\nconstruct our Powerful Plain Graph Transformers (PPGT): (1) simplified $L_2$\nattention for measuring the magnitude closeness among tokens; (2) adaptive\nroot-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3)\na simple MLP-based stem for graph positional encoding. Consistent with its\ntheoretical expressivity, PPGT demonstrates noteworthy realized expressivity on\nthe empirical graph expressivity benchmark, comparing favorably to more\ncomplicated competitors such as subgraph GNNs and higher-order GNNs.

    "summary": "Multi-scale representations are crucial for semantic segmentation. The\ncommunity has witnessed the flourish of semantic segmentation convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) exploiting multi-scale contextual information. Motivated\nby that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some\nsemantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining\nimpressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we\nsucceed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation\nViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and\nefficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the\nlocal window to query a larger area of context window at only a little\ncomputation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query\narea, we enable the $\\textit{large window attention}$ to capture the contextual\ninformation at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid\npooling is adopted to collaborate with $\\textit{the large window attention}$,\nwhich presents a novel decoder named $\\textbf{la}$rge $\\textbf{win}$dow\nattention spatial pyramid pooling (LawinASPP) for semantic segmentation ViT.\nOur resulting ViT, Lawin Transformer, is composed of an efficient hierachical\nvision transformer (HVT) as encoder and a LawinASPP as decoder.

    "summary": "Transformers have shown great power in time series forecasting due to their\nglobal-range modeling ability. However, their performance can degenerate\nterribly on non-stationary real-world data in which the joint distribution\nchanges over time. Previous studies primarily adopt stationarization to\nattenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability.\nBut the stationarized series deprived of inherent non-stationarity can be less\ninstructive for real-world bursty events forecasting. This problem, termed\nover-stationarization in this paper, leads Transformers to generate\nindistinguishable temporal attentions for different series and impedes the\npredictive capability of deep models. To tackle the dilemma between series\npredictability and model capability, we propose Non-stationary Transformers as\na generic framework with two interdependent modules: Series Stationarization\nand De-stationary Attention. Concretely, Series Stationarization unifies the\nstatistics of each input and converts the output with restored statistics for\nbetter predictability. To address the over-stationarization problem,\nDe-stationary Attention is devised to recover the intrinsic non-stationary\ninformation into temporal dependencies by approximating distinguishable\nattentions learned from raw series. Our Non-stationary Transformers framework\nconsistently boosts mainstream Transformers by a large margin, which reduces\nMSE by 49.43% on Transformer, 47.34% on Informer, and 46.89% on Reformer,\nmaking them the state-of-the-art in time series forecasting.

Self-attention allows\ntransformers to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitable\nfor sequence modeling. However, the process by which transformers learn such\ncausal structure via gradient-based training algorithms remains poorly\nunderstood. To better understand this process, we introduce an in-context\nlearning task that requires learning latent causal structure. We prove that\ngradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve this\ntask by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The key\ninsight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes the\nmutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processing\ninequality, the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in the\nlatent causal graph. As a special case, when the sequences are generated from\nin-context Markov chains, we prove that transformers learn an induction head\n(Olsson et al., 2022).

Nonetheless, their\nquadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention\nlayers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for\ndeployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming\nPretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment\npretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory\ngating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits\nsuch as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained\nmodels, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m,\nOpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across\narchitectures of different scales.

Modern deep learning models leverage motion by\neither executing spatio-temporal 3D convolutions, factorizing 3D convolutions\ninto spatial and temporal convolutions separately, or computing self-attention\nalong temporal dimension. The implicit assumption behind such successes is that\nthe feature maps across consecutive frames can be nicely aggregated.\nNevertheless, the assumption may not always hold especially for the regions\nwith large deformation. In this paper, we present a new recipe of inter-frame\nattention block, namely Stand-alone Inter-Frame Attention (SIFA), that novelly\ndelves into the deformation across frames to estimate local self-attention on\neach spatial location. Technically, SIFA remoulds the deformable design via\nre-scaling the offset predictions by the difference between two frames. Taking\neach spatial location in the current frame as the query, the locally deformable\nneighbors in the next frame are regarded as the keys/values. Then, SIFA\nmeasures the similarity between query and keys as stand-alone attention to\nweighted average the values for temporal aggregation.

Specifically, we first divide the\ninput image into patches as commonly done, and each patch is viewed as a token.\nThen, the proposed H-MHSA learns token relationships within local patches,\nserving as local relationship modeling. Then, the small patches are merged into\nlarger ones, and H-MHSA models the global dependencies for the small number of\nthe merged tokens. At last, the local and global attentive features are\naggregated to obtain features with powerful representation capacity. Since we\nonly calculate attention for a limited number of tokens at each step, the\ncomputational load is reduced dramatically. Hence, H-MHSA can efficiently model\nglobal relationships among tokens without sacrificing fine-grained information.\nWith the H-MHSA module incorporated, we build a family of\nHierarchical-Attention-based Transformer Networks, namely HAT-Net. To\ndemonstrate the superiority of HAT-Net in scene understanding, we conduct\nextensive experiments on fundamental vision tasks, including image\nclassification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance\nsegmentation. Therefore, HAT-Net provides a new perspective for vision\ntransformers. Code and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/yun-liu/HAT-Net.",

    "summary": "Accurate segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images is crucial for\nreliable diagnosis of diseases and organ morphometry. In recent years,\nconvolutional encoder-decoder solutions have achieved substantial progress in\nthe field of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the inherent bias in\nthe convolution operations, prior models mainly focus on local visual cues\nformed by the neighboring pixels, but fail to fully model the long-range\ncontextual dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based\nAttention Guided Network called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided\nattention and multi-scale skip connection are designed to jointly enhance the\nperformance of the semantical segmentation architecture. Inspired by\nTransformer, the self-aware attention (SAA) module with Transformer Self\nAttention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into\nTransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions among encoder\nfeatures. Moreover, we also use additional multi-scale skip connections between\ndecoder blocks to aggregate the upsampled features with different semantic\nscales. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context\ninformation is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting\nfrom these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively\nalleviate the loss of fine details caused by the stacking of convolution layers\nand the consecutive sampling operations, finally improving the segmentation\nquality of medical images. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image\nsegmentation datasets from different imaging modalities demonstrate that the\nproposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

    "summary": "In recent years, transformer models have revolutionized Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) and shown promising performance on Computer Vision (CV) tasks.\nDespite their effectiveness, transformers' attention operations are hard to\naccelerate due to the complicated data movement and quadratic computational\ncomplexity, prohibiting the real-time inference on resource-constrained\nedge-computing platforms.\n  To tackle this challenge, we propose Energon, an algorithm-architecture\nco-design approach that accelerates various transformers using dynamic sparse\nattention. With the observation that attention results only depend on a few\nimportant query-key pairs, we propose a Mix-Precision Multi-Round Filtering\n(MP-MRF) algorithm to dynamically identify such pairs at runtime. We adopt low\nbitwidth in each filtering round and only use high-precision tensors in the\nattention stage to reduce overall complexity. By this means, we significantly\nmitigate the computational cost with negligible accuracy loss. To enable such\nan algorithm with lower latency and better energy efficiency, we also propose\nan Energon co-processor architecture. Elaborated pipelines and specialized\noptimizations jointly boost the performance and reduce power consumption.\nExtensive experiments on both NLP and CV benchmarks demonstrate that Energon\nachieves $168\\times$ and $8.7\\times$ geo-mean speedup and up to $10^4\\times$\nand $10^3\\times$ energy reduction compared with Intel Xeon 5220 CPU and NVIDIA\nV100 GPU.

    "summary": "We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with\nhierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to\ndiscard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach\nconsists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group\nWindow Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate\nthe quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches,\ngroup attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each\nlocal window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked\nself-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve\nthe grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the\noverall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for\nthe convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works\nseamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result,\nMIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and\nefficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin\nTransformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU\nmemory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet\nclassification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection\nbenchmarks.

    "summary": "Vision transformer has achieved impressive performance for many vision tasks.\nHowever, it may suffer from high redundancy in capturing local features for\nshallow layers. Local self-attention or early-stage convolutions are thus\nutilized, which sacrifice the capacity to capture long-range dependency. A\nchallenge then arises: can we access efficient and effective global context\nmodeling at the early stages of a neural network? To address this issue, we\ndraw inspiration from the design of superpixels, which reduces the number of\nimage primitives in subsequent processing, and introduce super tokens into\nvision transformer. Super tokens attempt to provide a semantically meaningful\ntessellation of visual content, thus reducing the token number in\nself-attention as well as preserving global modeling. Specifically, we propose\na simple yet strong super token attention (STA) mechanism with three steps: the\nfirst samples super tokens from visual tokens via sparse association learning,\nthe second performs self-attention on super tokens, and the last maps them back\nto the original token space. STA decomposes vanilla global attention into\nmultiplications of a sparse association map and a low-dimensional attention,\nleading to high efficiency in capturing global dependencies. Based on STA, we\ndevelop a hierarchical vision transformer. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nits strong performance on various vision tasks. In particular, without any\nextra training data or label, it achieves 86.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nwith less than 100M parameters.

Another\nissue is that most Transformer-based IR methods focus only on either local or\nglobal features, leading to limited receptive fields or deficient parameter\nissues. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight IR network,\nReciprocal Attention Mixing Transformer (RAMiT).

To\naddress this issue, we propose a Graph-based Vision Transformer (GvT) that\nutilizes graph convolutional projection and graph-pooling. In each block,\nqueries and keys are calculated through graph convolutional projection based on\nthe spatial adjacency matrix, while dot-product attention is used in another\ngraph convolution to generate values.

To overcome this low-rank bottleneck in\nattention heads, we employ talking-heads technology based on bilinear pooled\nfeatures and sparse selection of attention tensors. This allows interaction\namong filtered attention scores and enables each attention mechanism to depend\non all queries and keys.

This raises the\nquestion: do transformer-based denoising networks exhibit inductive biases that\ncan also be expressed via geometry-adaptive harmonic bases? To our surprise, we\nfind that this is not the case. This discrepancy motivates our search for the\ninductive bias that can lead to good generalization in DiT models.\nInvestigating the pivotal attention modules of a DiT, we find that locality of\nattention maps are closely associated with generalization. To verify this\nfinding, we modify the generalization of a DiT by restricting its attention\nwindows. We inject local attention windows to a DiT and observe an improvement\nin generalization. Furthermore, we empirically find that both the placement and\nthe effective attention size of these local attention windows are crucial\nfactors.

A handful of existing works focus on dirty-label attacks with\nwrongly-labeled poisoned training samples, which may fail if a benign model\ntrainer corrects the labels. In this paper, we propose Megatron, an evasive\nclean-label backdoor attack against vision transformers, where the attacker\ninjects the backdoor without manipulating the data-labeling process. To\ngenerate an effective trigger, we customize two loss terms based on the\nattention mechanism used in transformer networks, i.e., latent loss and\nattention diffusion loss. The latent loss aligns the last attention layer\nbetween triggered samples and clean samples of the target label. The attention\ndiffusion loss emphasizes the attention diffusion area that encompasses the\ntrigger. A theoretical analysis is provided to underpin the rationale behind\nthe attention diffusion loss. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB,\nCIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of Megatron.\nMegatron can achieve attack success rates of over 90% even when the position of\nthe trigger is slightly shifted during testing.

    "summary": "This paper presents \\textbf{FreEformer}, a simple yet effective model that\nleverages a \\textbf{Fre}quency \\textbf{E}nhanced Trans\\textbf{former} for\nmultivariate time series forecasting. Our work is based on the assumption that\nthe frequency spectrum provides a global perspective on the composition of\nseries across various frequencies and is highly suitable for robust\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, we first convert time series into the\ncomplex frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The\nTransformer architecture is then applied to the frequency spectra to capture\ncross-variate dependencies, with the real and imaginary parts processed\nindependently. However, we observe that the vanilla attention matrix exhibits a\nlow-rank characteristic, thus limiting representation diversity. This could be\nattributed to the inherent sparsity of the frequency domain and the\nstrong-value-focused nature of Softmax in vanilla attention. To address this,\nwe enhance the vanilla attention mechanism by introducing an additional\nlearnable matrix to the original attention matrix, followed by row-wise L1\nnormalization. Theoretical analysis~demonstrates that this enhanced attention\nmechanism improves both feature diversity and gradient flow. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that FreEformer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models on eighteen real-world benchmarks covering electricity,\ntraffic, weather, healthcare and finance. Notably, the enhanced attention\nmechanism also consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art\nTransformer-based forecasters.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based large pre-trained models have shown remarkable\ngeneralization ability, and various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)\nmethods have been proposed to customize these models on downstream tasks with\nminimal computational and memory budgets. Previous PEFT methods are primarily\ndesigned from a tensor-decomposition perspective that tries to effectively tune\nthe linear transformation by finding the smallest subset of parameters to\ntrain. Our study adopts an orthogonal view by representing the attention\noperation as a graph convolution and formulating the multi-head attention maps\nas a convolutional filter subspace, with each attention map as a subspace\nelement. In this paper, we propose to tune the large pre-trained transformers\nby learning a small set of combination coefficients that construct a more\nexpressive filter subspace from the original multi-head attention maps. We show\nanalytically and experimentally that the tuned filter subspace can effectively\nexpand the feature space of the multi-head attention and further enhance the\ncapacity of transformers. We further stabilize the fine-tuning with a residual\nparameterization of the tunable subspace coefficients, and enhance the\ngeneralization with a regularization design by directly applying dropout on the\ntunable coefficient during training. The tunable coefficients take a tiny\nnumber of parameters and can be combined with previous PEFT methods in a\nplug-and-play manner.

    "summary": "Attention mechanisms and non-local mean operations in general are key\ningredients in many state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular,\nthe Transformer model based on multi-head self-attention has recently achieved\ngreat success in natural language processing and computer vision. However, the\nvanilla algorithm computing the Transformer of an image with n pixels has\nO(n^2) complexity, which is often painfully slow and sometimes prohibitively\nexpensive for large-scale image data. In this paper, we propose a fast\nrandomized algorithm --- SCRAM --- that only requires O(n log(n)) time to\nproduce an image attention map. Such a dramatic acceleration is attributed to\nour insight that attention maps on real-world images usually exhibit (1)\nspatial coherence and (2) sparse structure. The central idea of SCRAM is to\nemploy PatchMatch, a randomized correspondence algorithm, to quickly pinpoint\nthe most compatible key (argmax) for each query first, and then exploit that\nknowledge to design a sparse approximation to non-local mean operations. Using\nthe argmax (mode) to dynamically construct the sparse approximation\ndistinguishes our algorithm from all of the existing sparse approximate methods\nand makes it very efficient. Moreover, SCRAM is a broadly applicable\napproximation to any non-local mean layer in contrast to some other sparse\napproximations that can only approximate self-attention. Our preliminary\nexperimental results suggest that SCRAM is indeed promising for speeding up or\nscaling up the computation of attention maps in the Transformer.",

    "summary": "Attention mechanism has been widely believed as the key to success of vision\ntransformers (ViTs), since it provides a flexible and powerful way to model\nspatial relationships. However, is the attention mechanism truly an\nindispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To\ndemystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely\nsimple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift\noperation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The\nonly operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between\nneighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new\nbackbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are\nsubstituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in\nseveral mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation.\nThe performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin\nTransformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be\nthe vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a\nzero-parameter operation.

    "summary": "Despite the success of vision transformers (ViTs), they still suffer from\nsignificant drops in accuracy in the presence of common corruptions, such as\nnoise or blur. Interestingly, we observe that the attention mechanism of ViTs\ntends to rely on few important tokens, a phenomenon we call token overfocusing.\nMore critically, these tokens are not robust to corruptions, often leading to\nhighly diverging attention patterns. In this paper, we intend to alleviate this\noverfocusing issue and make attention more stable through two general\ntechniques: First, our Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module encourages the\nlocal neighborhood of each token to take part in the attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, TAP learns average pooling schemes for each token such that the\ninformation of potentially important tokens in the neighborhood can adaptively\nbe taken into account. Second, we force the output tokens to aggregate\ninformation from a diverse set of input tokens rather than focusing on just a\nfew by using our Attention Diversification Loss (ADL). We achieve this by\npenalizing high cosine similarity between the attention vectors of different\ntokens. In experiments, we apply our methods to a wide range of transformer\narchitectures and improve robustness significantly. For example, we improve\ncorruption robustness on ImageNet-C by 2.4% while improving accuracy by 0.4%\nbased on state-of-the-art robust architecture FAN.

First, in low-resolution stages of the generative\nprocess, standard global self-attention is replaced with the proposed\nmulti-axis blocked self-attention which allows efficient mixing of local and\nglobal attention. Second, in high-resolution stages, we drop self-attention\nwhile only keeping multi-layer perceptrons reminiscent of the implicit neural\nfunction. To further improve the performance, we introduce an additional\nself-modulation component based on cross-attention. The resulting model,\ndenoted as HiT, has a nearly linear computational complexity with respect to\nthe image size and thus directly scales to synthesizing high definition images.\nWe show in the experiments that the proposed HiT achieves state-of-the-art FID\nscores of 30.83 and 2.95 on unconditional ImageNet $128 \\times 128$ and FFHQ\n$256 \\times 256$, respectively, with a reasonable throughput.

Various attempts on\napproximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been\nmade in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work\nshows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for\nvisual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in\nkeeping the softmax self-attention during approximations.

In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for\nhandling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined\nspace-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and\neach patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a\nfrequency band.

We provide an optimized implementation, making it a\ndrop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive\nexperiments show that CoCA performs extraordinarily well in extending context\nwindows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can\nseamlessly extend the context window up to 32K (60$\\times$), without any\nfine-tuning. Additionally, by dropping CoCA in LLaMA-7B, we achieve\nextrapolation up to 32K within only 2K training length.

Hierarchical shifted window (Swin) transformer, often used in medical\nimage analysis cannot use attention guided masking as it lacks an explicit\n[CLS] token, needed for computing attention maps for selective masking. We thus\nenhanced Swin with semantic class attention. We developed a co-distilled Swin\ntransformer that combines a noisy momentum updated teacher to guide selective\nmasking for MIM.

In order to fully\nutilize the ViT-based architecture in various applications, proper\nvisualization methods with a decent localization performance are necessary, but\nthese methods employed in CNN-based models are still not available in ViT due\nto its unique structure. In this work, we propose an attention-guided\nvisualization method applied to ViT that provides a high-level semantic\nexplanation for its decision. Our method selectively aggregates the gradients\ndirectly propagated from the classification output to each self-attention,\ncollecting the contribution of image features extracted from each location of\nthe input image. These gradients are additionally guided by the normalized\nself-attention scores, which are the pairwise patch correlation scores. They\nare used to supplement the gradients on the patch-level context information\nefficiently detected by the self-attention mechanism. This approach of our\nmethod provides elaborate high-level semantic explanations with great\nlocalization performance only with the class labels. As a result, our method\noutperforms the previous leading explainability methods of ViT in the\nweakly-supervised localization task and presents great capability in capturing\nthe full instances of the target class object.

    "summary": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-contact method for detecting\nphysiological signals based on facial videos, holding high potential in various\napplications. Due to the periodicity nature of rPPG signals, the long-range\ndependency capturing capacity of the transformer was assumed to be advantageous\nfor such signals. However, existing methods have not conclusively demonstrated\nthe superior performance of transformers over traditional convolutional neural\nnetworks. This may be attributed to the quadratic scaling exhibited by\ntransformer with sequence length, resulting in coarse-grained feature\nextraction, which in turn affects robustness and generalization. To address\nthat, this paper proposes a periodic sparse attention mechanism based on\ntemporal attention sparsity induced by periodicity. A pre-attention stage is\nintroduced before the conventional attention mechanism. This stage learns\nperiodic patterns to filter out a large number of irrelevant attention\ncomputations, thus enabling fine-grained feature extraction. Moreover, to\naddress the issue of fine-grained features being more susceptible to noise\ninterference, a fusion stem is proposed to effectively guide self-attention\ntowards rPPG features. It can be easily integrated into existing methods to\nenhance their performance.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to\ntake Multi-Query Attention a step further by also sharing key and value heads\nbetween adjacent layers, yielding a new attention design we call Cross-Layer\nAttention (CLA).

ViTs show strong capability for image understanding tasks such as\nobject detection, segmentation, and classification. This is due in part to\ntheir ability to leverage global information from interactions among visual\ntokens. However, the self-attention mechanism in ViTs are limited because they\ndo not allow visual tokens to exchange local or global information with\nneighboring features before computing global attention. This is problematic\nbecause tokens are treated in isolation when attending (matching) to other\ntokens, and valuable spatial relationships are overlooked. This isolation is\nfurther compounded by dot-product similarity operations that make tokens from\ndifferent semantic classes appear visually similar. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce two modifications to the traditional self-attention\nframework; a novel aggressive convolution pooling strategy for local feature\nmixing, and a new conceptual attention transformation to facilitate interaction\nand feature exchange between semantic concepts.

In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an\nefficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range\nattention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a\nshort-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a\ndual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two\nattention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and\nbidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains,\nincluding the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and\nImageNet classification.

    "summary": "In the past three years, there has been significant interest in hyperspectral\nimagery (HSI) classification using vision Transformers for analysis of remotely\nsensed data. Previous research predominantly focused on the empirical\nintegration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to augment the network's\ncapability to extract local feature information. Yet, the theoretical\njustification for vision Transformers out-performing CNN architectures in HSI\nclassification remains a question. To address this issue, a unified\nhierarchical spectral vision Transformer architecture, specifically tailored\nfor HSI classification, is investigated. In this streamlined yet effective\nvision Transformer architecture, multiple mixer modules are strategically\nintegrated separately. These include the CNN-mixer, which executes convolution\noperations; the spatial self-attention (SSA)-mixer and channel self-attention\n(CSA)-mixer, both of which are adaptations of classical self-attention blocks;\nand hybrid models such as the SSA+CNN-mixer and CSA+CNN-mixer, which merge\nconvolution with self-attention operations. This integration facilitates the\ndevelopment of a broad spectrum of vision Transformer-based models tailored for\nHSI classification. In terms of the training process, a comprehensive analysis\nis performed, contrasting classical CNN models and vision Transformer-based\ncounterparts, with particular attention to disturbance robustness and the\ndistribution of the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian.

Nevertheless, the large receptive field of Vision\nTransformer is accompanied by the huge computational cost. To boost efficiency,\nthe window-based Vision Transformers emerge. They crop an image into several\nlocal windows, and the self-attention is conducted within each window. To bring\nback the global receptive field, window-based Vision Transformers have devoted\na lot of efforts to achieving cross-window communications by developing several\nsophisticated operations. In this work, we check the necessity of the key\ndesign element of Swin Transformer, the shifted window partitioning. We\ndiscover that a simple depthwise convolution is sufficient for achieving\neffective cross-window communications. Specifically, with the existence of the\ndepthwise convolution, the shifted window configuration in Swin Transformer\ncannot lead to an additional performance improvement.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise\ninteractions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful,\nit does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and\nspace complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and\nspace attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax\nfunction, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a\ndrop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a\nstraightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating\nmechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate\nthat RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer\nbaselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as\na vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA\nis competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text\nclassification datasets.

The cross-view matching task is extremely\nchallenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views.\nUnlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a\nnovel evolving geo-localization Transformer (EgoTR) that utilizes the\nproperties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus\nsignificantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We\nalso exploit the positional encoding of Transformer to help the EgoTR\nunderstand and correspond geometric configurations between ground and aerial\nimages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumption on\ngeometry knowledge, the EgoTR flexibly learns the positional embeddings through\nthe training objective and hence becomes more practical in many real-world\nscenarios.

Our Multi-scale Attention Fusion (MAF) block consists\nof: i) a local window attention branch that learns short-range interactions\nwithin windows, aggregating fine-grained local features; ii) global feature\nextraction through a novel Global Learning with Down-sampling (GLD) operation\nto efficiently capture long-range context information within the whole image;\niii) a fusion module that self-explores the integration of both features via\nattention. Our MAFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on common vision\ntasks. In particular, MAFormer-L achieves 85.9$\\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet,\nsurpassing CSWin-B and LV-ViT-L by 1.7$\\%$ and 0.6$\\%$ respectively. On MSCOCO,\nMAFormer outperforms the prior art CSWin by 1.7$\\%$ mAPs on object detection\nand 1.4$\\%$ on instance segmentation with similar-sized parameters,\ndemonstrating the potential to be a general backbone network.",

    "summary": "Transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision tasks. By\nborrowing design concepts from transformers, many studies revolutionized CNNs\nand showed remarkable results. This paper falls in this line of studies.\nSpecifically, we propose a new convolutional neural network, ParCNetV2, that\nextends position-aware circular convolution (ParCNet) with oversized\nconvolutions and bifurcate gate units to enhance attention. The oversized\nconvolution employs a kernel with twice the input size to model long-range\ndependencies through a global receptive field. Simultaneously, it achieves\nimplicit positional encoding by removing the shift-invariant property from\nconvolution kernels, i.e., the effective kernels at different spatial locations\nare different when the kernel size is twice as large as the input size. The\nbifurcate gate unit implements an attention mechanism similar to self-attention\nin transformers. It is applied through element-wise multiplication of the two\nbranches, one serves as feature transformation while the other serves as\nattention weights. Additionally, we introduce a uniform local-global\nconvolution block to unify the design of the early and late stage convolution\nblocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nother convolutional neural networks and hybrid models that combine CNNs and\ntransformers. Code will be released.",

Precise segmentation of brain\ntumors facilitates clinical diagnosis, evaluations, and surgical planning. Deep\nlearning has recently emerged to improve brain tumor segmentation and achieved\nimpressive results. Convolutional architectures are widely used to implement\nthose neural networks. By the nature of limited receptive fields, however,\nthose architectures are subject to representing long-range spatial dependencies\nof the voxel intensities in MRI images. Transformers have been leveraged\nrecently to address the above limitations of convolutional networks.\nUnfortunately, the majority of current Transformers-based methods in\nsegmentation are performed with 2D MRI slices, instead of 3D volumes. Moreover,\nit is difficult to incorporate the structures between layers because each head\nis calculated independently in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA).\nIn this work, we proposed a 3D Transformer-based segmentation approach. We\ndeveloped a Fusion-Head Self-Attention mechanism (FHSA) to combine each\nattention head through attention logic and weight mapping, for the exploration\nof the long-range spatial dependencies in 3D MRI images. We implemented a\nplug-and-play self-attention module, named the Infinite Deformable Fusion\nTransformer Module (IDFTM), to extract features on any deformable feature maps.\nWe applied our approach to the task of brain tumor segmentation, and assessed\nit on the public BRATS datasets.

    "summary": "Transformer models have been widely adopted in various domains over the last\nyears, and especially large language models have advanced the field of AI\nsignificantly. Due to their size, the capability of these networks has\nincreased tremendously, but this has come at the cost of a significant increase\nin necessary compute. Quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce\nthe computational time and memory consumption of neural networks. Many studies\nhave shown, however, that modern transformer models tend to learn strong\noutliers in their activations, making them difficult to quantize. To retain\nacceptable performance, the existence of these outliers requires activations to\nbe in higher bitwidth or the use of different numeric formats, extra\nfine-tuning, or other workarounds. We show that strong outliers are related to\nvery specific behavior of attention heads that try to learn a \"no-op\" or just a\npartial update of the residual. To achieve the exact zeros needed in the\nattention matrix for a no-update, the input to the softmax is pushed to be\nlarger and larger during training, causing outliers in other parts of the\nnetwork. Based on these observations, we propose two simple (independent)\nmodifications to the attention mechanism - clipped softmax and gated attention.\nWe empirically show that models pre-trained using our methods learn\nsignificantly smaller outliers while maintaining and sometimes even improving\nthe floating-point task performance. This enables us to quantize transformers\nto full INT8 quantization of the activations without any additional effort. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both language models (BERT,\nOPT) and vision transformers.",

Recently,\nTransformer-based models have shown competitive performance in RSISR. To\nmitigate the quadratic computational complexity resulting from global\nself-attention, various methods constrain attention to a local window,\nenhancing its efficiency. Consequently, the receptive fields in a single\nattention layer are inadequate, leading to insufficient context modeling.\nFurthermore, while most transform-based approaches reuse shallow features\nthrough skip connections, relying solely on these connections treats shallow\nand deep features equally, impeding the model's ability to characterize them.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel transformer architecture called\nCross-Spatial Pixel Integration and Cross-Stage Feature Fusion Based\nTransformer Network (SPIFFNet) for RSISR.

    "summary": "Transformer-based large language models (e.g., BERT and GPT) achieve great\nsuccess, and fine-tuning, which tunes a pre-trained model on a task-specific\ndataset, is the standard practice to utilize these models for downstream tasks.\nHowever, Transformer fine-tuning has long running time and high memory\nconsumption due to the large size of the models. We propose the SPT system to\nfine-tune Transformer-based models efficiently by introducing sparsity. We\nobserve that the memory consumption of Transformer mainly comes from storing\nattention weights for multi-head attention (MHA), and the majority of running\ntime is spent on feed-forward network (FFN). Thus, we design the sparse MHA\nmodule, which computes and stores only large attention weights to reduce memory\nconsumption, and the routed FFN module, which dynamically activates a subset of\nmodel parameters for each token to reduce computation cost. We implement SPT on\nPyTorch and customize CUDA kernels to run sparse MHA and routed FFN\nefficiently. Specifically, we use product quantization to identify the large\nattention weights and compute attention via sparse matrix multiplication for\nsparse MHA. For routed FFN, we batch the tokens according to their activated\nmodel parameters for efficient computation. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate SPT on various model configurations. The results show that SPT\nconsistently outperforms well-optimized baselines, reducing the peak memory\nconsumption by up to 50% and accelerating fine-tuning by up to 2.2x.",

    "summary": "In-context learning (ICL) is a cornerstone of large language model (LLM)\nfunctionality, yet its theoretical foundations remain elusive due to the\ncomplexity of transformer architectures. In particular, most existing work only\ntheoretically explains how the attention mechanism facilitates ICL under\ncertain data models. It remains unclear how the other building blocks of the\ntransformer contribute to ICL. To address this question, we study how a\ntwo-attention-layer transformer is trained to perform ICL on $n$-gram Markov\nchain data, where each token in the Markov chain statistically depends on the\nprevious $n$ tokens. We analyze a sophisticated transformer model featuring\nrelative positional embedding, multi-head softmax attention, and a feed-forward\nlayer with normalization. We prove that the gradient flow with respect to a\ncross-entropy ICL loss converges to a limiting model that performs a\ngeneralized version of the induction head mechanism with a learned feature,\nresulting from the congruous contribution of all the building blocks. In the\nlimiting model, the first attention layer acts as a $\\mathit{copier}$, copying\npast tokens within a given window to each position, and the feed-forward\nnetwork with normalization acts as a $\\mathit{selector}$ that generates a\nfeature vector by only looking at informationally relevant parents from the\nwindow. Finally, the second attention layer is a $\\mathit{classifier}$ that\ncompares these features with the feature at the output position, and uses the\nresulting similarity scores to generate the desired output. Our theory is\nfurther validated by experiments.",

While the self-attention\nmechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling\ncomplex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity\nof the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers,\nthereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the\nconnection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means\n(NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention\nmechanism that uses kernel twicing procedure in nonparametric regression to\nalleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling\ntheoretical guarantees and enhanced adversarial robustness.

Previous efforts have focused on designing\nvarious downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions\nbetween tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture\nrelations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we\nattempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning\nmodules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it\nis foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to\nthe quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the\ninput sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:\noverly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the\ntagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention\nmechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former\nmodifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local\nattention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different\nattention windows.

However, existing hardware accelerators\nlack support for spiking attention, exhibit limited throughput in exploiting\nfine-grained sparsity, and struggle with scalable parallelism in sparse\ncomputation. To address these, we propose FireFly-T, a dual-engine overlay\narchitecture that integrates a sparse engine for activation sparsity and a\nbinary engine for spiking attention. In the sparse engine, we propose a\nhighthroughput sparse decoder that exploits fine-grained sparsity by\nconcurrently extracting multiple non-zero spikes.

    "title": "On the Robustness of Vision Transformers to Adversarial Examples",
    "summary": "Recent advances in attention-based networks have shown that Vision\nTransformers can achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art results on\nmany image classification tasks. This puts transformers in the unique position\nof being a promising alternative to traditional convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs). While CNNs have been carefully studied with respect to adversarial\nattacks, the same cannot be said of Vision Transformers. In this paper, we\nstudy the robustness of Vision Transformers to adversarial examples. Our\nanalyses of transformer security is divided into three parts. First, we test\nthe transformer under standard white-box and black-box attacks. Second, we\nstudy the transferability of adversarial examples between CNNs and\ntransformers. We show that adversarial examples do not readily transfer between\nCNNs and transformers. Based on this finding, we analyze the security of a\nsimple ensemble defense of CNNs and transformers. By creating a new attack, the\nself-attention blended gradient attack, we show that such an ensemble is not\nsecure under a white-box adversary. However, under a black-box adversary, we\nshow that an ensemble can achieve unprecedented robustness without sacrificing\nclean accuracy. Our analysis for this work is done using six types of white-box\nattacks and two types of black-box attacks. Our study encompasses multiple\nVision Transformers, Big Transfer Models and CNN architectures trained on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet.",

    "summary": "In this work, quantum transformers are designed and analysed in detail by\nextending the state-of-the-art classical transformer neural network\narchitectures known to be very performant in natural language processing and\nimage analysis. Building upon the previous work, which uses parametrised\nquantum circuits for data loading and orthogonal neural layers, we introduce\nthree types of quantum transformers for training and inference, including a\nquantum transformer based on compound matrices, which guarantees a theoretical\nadvantage of the quantum attention mechanism compared to their classical\ncounterpart both in terms of asymptotic run time and the number of model\nparameters. These quantum architectures can be built using shallow quantum\ncircuits and produce qualitatively different classification models. The three\nproposed quantum attention layers vary on the spectrum between closely\nfollowing the classical transformers and exhibiting more quantum\ncharacteristics. As building blocks of the quantum transformer, we propose a\nnovel method for loading a matrix as quantum states as well as two new\ntrainable quantum orthogonal layers adaptable to different levels of\nconnectivity and quality of quantum computers. We performed extensive\nsimulations of the quantum transformers on standard medical image datasets that\nshowed competitively, and at times better performance compared to the classical\nbenchmarks, including the best-in-class classical vision transformers. The\nquantum transformers we trained on these small-scale datasets require fewer\nparameters compared to standard classical benchmarks.

    "summary": "An inherent challenge in computing fully-explicit generalization bounds for\ntransformers involves obtaining covering number estimates for the given\ntransformer class $T$. Crude estimates rely on a uniform upper bound on the\nlocal-Lipschitz constants of transformers in $T$, and finer estimates require\nan analysis of their higher-order partial derivatives. Unfortunately, these\nprecise higher-order derivative estimates for (realistic) transformer models\nare not currently available in the literature as they are combinatorially\ndelicate due to the intricate compositional structure of transformer blocks.\n  This paper fills this gap by precisely estimating all the higher-order\nderivatives of all orders for the transformer model. We consider realistic\ntransformers with multiple (non-linearized) attention heads per block and layer\nnormalization. We obtain fully-explicit estimates of all constants in terms of\nthe number of attention heads, the depth and width of each transformer block,\nand the number of normalization layers. Further, we explicitly analyze the\nimpact of various standard activation function choices (e.g. SWISH and GeLU).\nAs an application, we obtain explicit pathwise generalization bounds for\ntransformers on a single trajectory of an exponentially-ergodic Markov process\nvalid at a fixed future time horizon. We conclude that real-world transformers\ncan learn from $N$ (non-i.i.d.) samples of a single Markov process's trajectory\nat a rate of ${O}(\\operatorname{polylog}(N)/\\sqrt{N})$.",

NFN are specialized neural networks that treat the\nweights, gradients, or sparsity patterns of a deep neural network (DNN) as\ninput data and have proven valuable for tasks such as learnable optimizers,\nimplicit data representations, and weight editing. While NFN have been\nextensively developed for MLP and CNN, no prior work has addressed their design\nfor transformers, despite the importance of transformers in modern deep\nlearning. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic study\nof NFN for transformers. We first determine the maximal symmetric group of the\nweights in a multi-head attention module as well as a necessary and sufficient\ncondition under which two sets of hyperparameters of the multi-head attention\nmodule define the same function. We then define the weight space of transformer\narchitectures and its associated group action, which leads to the design\nprinciples for NFN in transformers. Based on these, we introduce\nTransformer-NFN, an NFN that is equivariant under this group action.\nAdditionally, we release a dataset of more than 125,000 Transformers model\ncheckpoints trained on two datasets with two different tasks, providing a\nbenchmark for evaluating Transformer-NFN and encouraging further research on\ntransformer training and performance.",

    "summary": "Action localization networks are often structured as a feature encoder\nsub-network and a localization sub-network, where the feature encoder learns to\ntransform an input video to features that are useful for the localization\nsub-network to generate reliable action proposals. While some of the encoded\nfeatures may be more useful for generating action proposals, prior action\nlocalization approaches do not include any attention mechanism that enables the\nlocalization sub-network to attend more to the more important features. In this\npaper, we propose a novel attention mechanism, the Class Semantics-based\nAttention (CSA), that learns from the temporal distribution of semantics of\naction classes present in an input video to find the importance scores of the\nencoded features, which are used to provide attention to the more useful\nencoded features. We demonstrate on two popular action detection datasets that\nincorporating our novel attention mechanism provides considerable performance\ngains on competitive action detection models (e.g., around 6.2% improvement\nover BMN action detection baseline to obtain 47.5% mAP on the THUMOS-14\ndataset), and a new state-of-the-art of 36.25% mAP on the ActivityNet v1.3\ndataset. Further, the CSA localization model family which includes BMN-CSA, was\npart of the second-placed submission at the 2021 ActivityNet action\nlocalization challenge.

We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function\nthrough formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network\nlayer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based\nattention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an\nelement based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear\nunit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression\nof negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the\nresulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU).\nThe attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the\nactivated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity\ntransformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient\nvanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of\nrelevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that\nAReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network\narchitectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced.\nNotably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates,\nwhich makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning and meta\nlearning.

However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are\neither not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or\nuse a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation\nparallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed\nsystems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both\ncommunication and computation parallelism when training linear attention\ntransformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work\nLASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear\nattention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of\nLASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed\non intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence\nlength, leading to significant improvements of both communication and\ncomputation parallelism, as well as their overlap.

PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long\nsequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The\nexperiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of\nPerformer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla\nTransformer on most of the tasks.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based models have demonstrated their effectiveness in automatic\nspeech recognition (ASR) tasks and even shown superior performance over the\nconventional hybrid framework. The main idea of Transformers is to capture the\nlong-range global context within an utterance by self-attention layers.\nHowever, for scenarios like conversational speech, such utterance-level\nmodeling will neglect contextual dependencies that span across utterances. In\nthis paper, we propose to explicitly model the inter-sentential information in\na Transformer based end-to-end architecture for conversational speech\nrecognition. Specifically, for the encoder network, we capture the contexts of\nprevious speech and incorporate such historic information into current input by\na context-aware residual attention mechanism. For the decoder, the prediction\nof current utterance is also conditioned on the historic linguistic information\nthrough a conditional decoder framework. We show the effectiveness of our\nproposed method on several open-source dialogue corpora and the proposed method\nconsistently improved the performance from the utterance-level\nTransformer-based ASR models.",

We\npropose a novel attention-based architecture, Depthformer for monocular depth\nestimation that uses multi-head self-attention to produce the multiscale\nfeature maps, which are effectively combined by our proposed decoder network.\nWe also propose a Transbins module that divides the depth range into bins whose\ncenter value is estimated adaptively per image.

    "summary": "Transformers are powerful visual learners, in large part due to their\nconspicuous lack of manually-specified priors. This flexibility can be\nproblematic in tasks that involve multiple-view geometry, due to the\nnear-infinite possible variations in 3D shapes and viewpoints (requiring\nflexibility), and the precise nature of projective geometry (obeying rigid\nlaws). To resolve this conundrum, we propose a \"light touch\" approach, guiding\nvisual Transformers to learn multiple-view geometry but allowing them to break\nfree when needed. We achieve this by using epipolar lines to guide the\nTransformer's cross-attention maps, penalizing attention values outside the\nepipolar lines and encouraging higher attention along these lines since they\ncontain geometrically plausible matches. Unlike previous methods, our proposal\ndoes not require any camera pose information at test-time. We focus on\npose-invariant object instance retrieval, where standard Transformer networks\nstruggle, due to the large differences in viewpoint between query and retrieved\nimages.

    "summary": "Over the past few decades, the hydrology community has witnessed notable\nadvancements in streamflow prediction, particularly with the introduction of\ncutting-edge machine-learning algorithms. Recurrent neural networks, especially\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become popular due to their\ncapacity to create precise forecasts and realistically mimic the system\ndynamics. Attention-based models, such as Transformers, can learn from the\nentire data sequence concurrently, a feature that LSTM does not have. This work\ntests the hypothesis that combining recurrence with attention can improve\nstreamflow prediction. We set up the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)\narchitecture, a model that combines both of these aspects and has never been\napplied in hydrology before. We compare the performance of LSTM, Transformers,\nand TFT over 2,610 globally distributed catchments from the recently available\nCaravan dataset. Our results demonstrate that TFT indeed exceeds the\nperformance benchmark set by the LSTM and Transformers for streamflow\nprediction. Additionally, being an explainable AI method, TFT helps in gaining\ninsights into the streamflow generation processes.",

To tackle this problem, we propose an Inverted Pyramid\nmulti-task Transformer, capable of modeling cross-task interaction among\nspatial features of different tasks in a global context. Specifically, we first\nutilize a transformer encoder to capture task-generic features for all tasks.\nAnd then, we design a transformer decoder to establish spatial and cross-task\ninteraction globally, and a novel UP-Transformer block is devised to increase\nthe resolutions of multi-task features gradually and establish cross-task\ninteraction at different scales. Furthermore, two types of Cross-Scale\nSelf-Attention modules, i.e., Fusion Attention and Selective Attention, are\nproposed to efficiently facilitate cross-task interaction across different\nfeature scales. An Encoder Feature Aggregation strategy is further introduced\nto better model multi-scale information in the decoder.

    "summary": "The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models\n(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,\nposition encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as\nlanguage. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard\napproach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in\nRoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a\nfunction of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual\ninput. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.\n  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme\nbased on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each\ntransformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an\nefficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact\nrepresentation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a\nFlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both\ntargeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling\nexperiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to\nRoPE and other recent baselines.",

    "summary": "Transformers have become prevalent in computer vision due to their\nperformance and flexibility in modelling complex operations. Of particular\nsignificance is the 'cross-attention' operation, which allows a vector\nrepresentation (e.g. of an object in an image) to be learned by attending to an\narbitrarily sized set of input features. Recently, \"Masked Attention\" was\nproposed in which a given object representation only attends to those image\npixel features for which the segmentation mask of that object is active. This\nspecialization of attention proved beneficial for various image and video\nsegmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose another specialization of\nattention which enables attending over `soft-masks' (those with continuous mask\nprobabilities instead of binary values), and is also differentiable through\nthese mask probabilities, thus allowing the mask used for attention to be\nlearned within the network without requiring direct loss supervision. This can\nbe useful for several applications. Specifically, we employ our \"Differentiable\nSoft-Masked Attention\" for the task of Weakly-Supervised Video Object\nSegmentation (VOS), where we develop a transformer-based network for VOS which\nonly requires a single annotated image frame for training, but can also benefit\nfrom cycle consistency training on a video with just one annotated frame.\nAlthough there is no loss for masks in unlabeled frames, the network is still\nable to segment objects in those frames due to our novel attention formulation.\nCode:\nhttps://github.com/Ali2500/HODOR/blob/main/hodor/modelling/encoder/soft_masked_attention.py",

In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets.

    "summary": "Medical image segmentation methods downsample images for feature extraction\nand then upsample them to restore resolution for pixel-level predictions. In\nsuch a schema, upsample technique is vital in restoring information for better\nperformance. However, existing upsample techniques leverage little information\nfrom downsampling paths. The local and detailed feature from the shallower\nlayer such as boundary and tissue texture is particularly more important in\nmedical segmentation compared with natural image segmentation. To this end, we\npropose a novel upsample approach for medical image segmentation, Window\nAttention Upsample (WAU), which upsamples features conditioned on local and\ndetailed features from downsampling path in local windows by introducing\nattention decoders of Transformer. WAU could serve as a general upsample method\nand be incorporated into any segmentation model that possesses lateral\nconnections. We first propose the Attention Upsample which consists of\nAttention Decoder (AD) and bilinear upsample. AD leverages pixel-level\nattention to model long-range dependency and global information for a better\nupsample. Bilinear upsample is introduced as the residual connection to\ncomplement the upsampled features. Moreover, considering the extensive memory\nand computation cost of pixel-level attention, we further design a window\nattention scheme to restrict attention computation in local windows instead of\nthe global range.

    "summary": "Despite the significant progress made by transformer models in machine\nreading comprehension tasks, they still fall short in handling complex\nreasoning tasks due to the absence of explicit knowledge in the input sequence.\nTo address this limitation, many recent works have proposed injecting external\nknowledge into the model. However, selecting relevant external knowledge,\nensuring its availability, and requiring additional processing steps remain\nchallenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel attention pattern that\nintegrates reasoning knowledge derived from a heterogeneous graph into the\ntransformer architecture without relying on external knowledge. The proposed\nattention pattern comprises three key elements: global-local attention for word\ntokens, graph attention for entity tokens that exhibit strong attention towards\ntokens connected in the graph as opposed to those unconnected, and the\nconsideration of the type of relationship between each entity token and word\ntoken. This results in optimized attention between the two if a relationship\nexists. The pattern is coupled with special relative position labels, allowing\nit to integrate with LUKE's entity-aware self-attention mechanism. The\nexperimental findings corroborate that our model outperforms both the\ncutting-edge LUKE-Graph and the baseline LUKE model across two distinct\ndatasets: ReCoRD, emphasizing commonsense reasoning, and WikiHop, focusing on\nmulti-hop reasoning challenges.",

    "summary": "Many continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) studies adopt\ntransformer-based architectures for sequence modeling due to their powerful\ncapacity for capturing global contexts. Nevertheless, vanilla self-attention,\nwhich serves as the core module of the transformer, calculates a weighted\naverage over all time steps; therefore, the local temporal semantics of sign\nvideos may not be fully exploited. In this study, we introduce a novel module\nin sign language recognition studies, called intra-inter gloss attention\nmodule, to leverage the relationships among frames within glosses and the\nsemantic and grammatical dependencies between glosses in the video. In the\nintra-gloss attention module, the video is divided into equally sized chunks\nand a self-attention mechanism is applied within each chunk. This localized\nself-attention significantly reduces complexity and eliminates noise introduced\nby considering non-relative frames. In the inter-gloss attention module, we\nfirst aggregate the chunk-level features within each gloss chunk by average\npooling along the temporal dimension. Subsequently, multi-head self-attention\nis applied to all chunk-level features. Given the non-significance of the\nsigner-environment interaction, we utilize segmentation to remove the\nbackground of the videos. This enables the proposed model to direct its focus\ntoward the signer.

    "summary": "We examine the intrinsic (within the attention head) and extrinsic (amongst\nthe attention heads) structure of the self-attention mechanism in transformers.\nTheoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax\nactivation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is\nsupported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic\norganization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing\nmethodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network\nstructure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query,\nkey, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential\nsince it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a\ngeometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify\nthis qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree\ncomprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and\nquantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion\ncoefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect\nto the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and\nheads of the network. To showcase the utility of our theoretical and\nmethodological findings, we provide computational examples using vision and\nlanguage transformers. The ramifications of these findings are two-fold: (1) a\nsubsequent step in interpretability analysis is theoretically admitted, and can\nbe exploited empirically for downstream interpretability tasks (2) one can use\nthe network 3-tensor organization for empirical network applications such as\nmodel pruning (by virtue of network sparsity) and network architecture\ncomparison.",

    "title": "CS-VLM: Compressed Sensing Attention for Efficient Vision-Language\n  Representation Learning",
    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for\njoint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image\ncaptioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these\nmodels scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the\nquadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental\ncomputational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where\nattention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,\nleading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the\nCompressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that\nreimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By\nprojecting high dimensional key and value representations into a\nlower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing\nthe attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly\nreduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal\nmathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision\nlanguage pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,\nhighlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient\nsolution for next generation multimodal transformers.",

    "summary": "Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through\nquery-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing\ndecoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still\nunderexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query\nparadigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.\nFurthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention\ndisentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many\nprocess), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),\naddressing \"query ambiguity\" and \"ROT\" issues directly, and enhancing decoder\nefficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size\npriors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.\nExtensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and\nWiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of\nDS-Det.

    "summary": "Transformer-based deep learning models are increasingly deployed on energy,\nand DRAM bandwidth constrained devices such as laptops and gaming consoles,\nwhich presents significant challenges in meeting the latency requirements of\nthe models. The industry is turning to neural processing units (NPUs) for\nsuperior performance-per-watt (perf/watt); however, efficiently mapping dynamic\nattention layers to the NPUs remains a challenging task. For optimizing\nperf/watt, AMD XDNA NPUs employ software managed caches and share system memory\nwith host. This requires substantial engineering effort to unlock efficient\ntiling, buffer allocation, and data movement to extract the maximum efficiency\nfrom the device. This paper introduces Zen-Attention, a framework that\noptimizes DRAM bandwidth utilization in the attention layer of models by\nsystematically exploring the complex design space of layer folding, tiling, and\ndata-movement on the interconnect, and the tensor layouts to come up with an\noptimal solution. Our evaluation includes comparative analysis of end-to-end\nmodel latency and specific attention latency in each model. We demonstrate how\nthe framework enhances mapping capabilities by varying input dimensions, which\nrequire padding and masking in the attention block. For representative\ntransformer models, the Zen-Attention Framework achieves up to 4x improvement\nin the latency of the attention block and up to 32% improvement in end-to-end\nnetwork latency compared to the baseline Unfolded- approaches.",

For example, a given text can have different targets\n(e.g., neighborhoods) and different aspects (e.g., price or safety), with\ndifferent sentiment associated with each target-aspect pair. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether adding context to self-attention models improves\nperformance on (T)ABSA. We propose two variants of Context-Guided BERT\n(CG-BERT) that learn to distribute attention under different contexts. We first\nadapt a context-aware Transformer to produce a CG-BERT that uses context-guided\nsoftmax-attention. Next, we propose an improved Quasi-Attention CG-BERT model\nthat learns a compositional attention that supports subtractive attention. We\ntrain both models with pretrained BERT on two (T)ABSA datasets: SentiHood and\nSemEval-2014 (Task 4). Both models achieve new state-of-the-art results with\nour QACG-BERT model having the best performance. Furthermore, we provide\nanalyses of the impact of context in the our proposed models. Our work provides\nmore evidence for the utility of adding context-dependencies to pretrained\nself-attention-based language models for context-based natural language tasks.",

    "summary": "Recent years have witnessed great success for hand reconstruction in\nreal-time applications such as visual reality and augmented reality while\ninteracting with two-hand reconstruction through efficient transformers is left\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a method called lightweight attention\nhand (LWA-HAND) to reconstruct hands in low flops from a single RGB image. To\nsolve the occlusion and interaction problem in efficient attention\narchitectures, we propose three mobile attention modules in this paper. The\nfirst module is a lightweight feature attention module that extracts both local\nocclusion representation and global image patch representation in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner. The second module is a cross image and graph bridge\nmodule which fuses image context and hand vertex. The third module is a\nlightweight cross-attention mechanism that uses element-wise operation for the\ncross-attention of two hands in linear complexity. The resulting model achieves\ncomparable performance on the InterHand2.6M benchmark in comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art models. Simultaneously, it reduces the flops to $0.47GFlops$\nwhile the state-of-the-art models have heavy computations between $10GFlops$\nand $20GFlops$.",

    "summary": "We investigate the self-attention mechanism of BERT in a fine-tuning scenario\nfor the classification of scientific articles over a taxonomy of research\ndisciplines. We observe how self-attention focuses on words that are highly\nrelated to the domain of the article. Particularly, a small subset of\nvocabulary words tends to receive most of the attention. We compare and\nevaluate the subset of the most attended words with feature selection methods\nnormally used for text classification in order to characterize self-attention\nas a possible feature selection approach. Using ConceptNet as ground truth, we\nalso find that attended words are more related to the research fields of the\narticles. However, conventional feature selection methods are still a better\noption to learn classifiers from scratch. This result suggests that, while\nself-attention identifies domain-relevant terms, the discriminatory information\nin BERT is encoded in the contextualized outputs and the classification layer.\nIt also raises the question whether injecting feature selection methods in the\nself-attention mechanism could further optimize single sequence classification\nusing transformers.",

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.",

Goal-directed reading, i.e., reading a\npassage to answer a question in mind, is a common real-world task that strongly\nengages attention. Here, we investigate what computational models can explain\nattention distribution in this complex task. We show that the reading time on\neach word is predicted by the attention weights in transformer-based deep\nneural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform the same reading task. Eye-tracking\nfurther reveals that readers separately attend to basic text features and\nquestion-relevant information during first-pass reading and rereading,\nrespectively. Similarly, text features and question relevance separately\nmodulate attention weights in shallow and deep DNN layers. Furthermore, when\nreaders scan a passage without a question in mind, their reading time is\npredicted by DNNs optimized for a word prediction task. Therefore, attention\nduring real-world reading can be interpreted as the consequence of task\noptimization.",

Especially, SA heads in lower layers capture various\nphonetic characteristics by the query-key dot product, which is designed to\ncompute the pairwise relationship between frames. In this paper, we propose a\nvariant of SA to extract more representative phonetic features. The proposed\nphonetic self-attention (phSA) is composed of two different types of phonetic\nattention; one is similarity-based and the other is content-based. In short,\nsimilarity-based attention captures the correlation between frames while\ncontent-based attention only considers each frame without being affected by\nother frames. We identify which parts of the original dot product equation are\nrelated to two different attention patterns and improve each part with simple\nmodifications.

The key idea is to model\nlong-term correlations and dependencies, which are crucial for accurate noisy\nspeech modeling, through the multi-head attention mechanisms. For this purpose,\nU-Former incorporates multi-head attention mechanisms at two levels: 1) a\nmulti-head self-attention module which calculate the attention map along both\ntime- and frequency-axis to generate time and frequency sub-attention maps for\nleveraging global interactions between encoder features, while 2) multi-head\ncross-attention module which are inserted in the skip connections allows a fine\nrecovery in the decoder by filtering out uncorrelated features.

Automatic\npruning is one of effective methods for reducing computation complexity without\nheuristic approaches.

In this paper, we propose an\nautomatic channel pruning method to take into account the multi-head attention\nmechanism.

    "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance but still\nrequire a high computation cost as compared to convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), one reason is that ViTs' attention measures global similarities and\nthus has a quadratic complexity with the number of input tokens. Existing\nefficient ViTs adopt local attention (e.g., Swin) or linear attention (e.g.,\nPerformer), which sacrifice ViTs' capabilities of capturing either global or\nlocal context. In this work, we ask an important research question: Can ViTs\nlearn both global and local context while being more efficient during\ninference? To this end, we propose a framework called Castling-ViT, which\ntrains ViTs using both linear-angular attention and masked softmax-based\nquadratic attention, but then switches to having only linear angular attention\nduring ViT inference. Our Castling-ViT leverages angular kernels to measure the\nsimilarities between queries and keys via spectral angles. And we further\nsimplify it with two techniques: (1) a novel linear-angular attention\nmechanism: we decompose the angular kernels into linear terms and high-order\nresiduals, and only keep the linear terms; and (2) we adopt two parameterized\nmodules to approximate high-order residuals: a depthwise convolution and an\nauxiliary masked softmax attention to help learn both global and local\ninformation, where the masks for softmax attention are regularized to gradually\nbecome zeros and thus incur no overhead during ViT inference. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on three tasks consistently validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed Castling-ViT, e.g., achieving up to a 1.8% higher\naccuracy or 40% MACs reduction on ImageNet classification and 1.2 higher mAP on\nCOCO detection under comparable FLOPs, as compared to ViTs with vanilla\nsoftmax-based attentions.",

    "summary": "Attention-based neural networks, such as Transformers, have become ubiquitous\nin numerous applications, including computer vision, natural language\nprocessing, and time-series analysis. In all kinds of attention networks, the\nattention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input\ntokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning\nbased on representations , wherein the attention maps of different layers are\nlearned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the\nevolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual\nconvolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the\nattention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a\nresidual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token\nrelationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an\nevolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it\nis beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this\nprocess. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced\nevolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various\napplications, including time-series representation, natural language\nunderstanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on\ntime-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated\nConvolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models\nsignificantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best\nSOTA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly\nmodels the layer-wise evolution of attention maps.

Basically, the visual\ntransformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then\ncalculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are\nof high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity\nof the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in\ndifferent scales and locations.

    "summary": "Despite the tantalizing success in a broad of vision tasks, transformers have\nnot yet demonstrated on-par ability as ConvNets in high-resolution image\ngenerative modeling. In this paper, we seek to explore using pure transformers\nto build a generative adversarial network for high-resolution image synthesis.\nTo this end, we believe that local attention is crucial to strike the balance\nbetween computational efficiency and modeling capacity. Hence, the proposed\ngenerator adopts Swin transformer in a style-based architecture. To achieve a\nlarger receptive field, we propose double attention which simultaneously\nleverages the context of the local and the shifted windows, leading to improved\ngeneration quality. Moreover, we show that offering the knowledge of the\nabsolute position that has been lost in window-based transformers greatly\nbenefits the generation quality. The proposed StyleSwin is scalable to high\nresolutions, with both the coarse geometry and fine structures benefit from the\nstrong expressivity of transformers. However, blocking artifacts occur during\nhigh-resolution synthesis because performing the local attention in a\nblock-wise manner may break the spatial coherency. To solve this, we\nempirically investigate various solutions, among which we find that employing a\nwavelet discriminator to examine the spectral discrepancy effectively\nsuppresses the artifacts. Extensive experiments show the superiority over prior\ntransformer-based GANs, especially on high resolutions, e.g., 1024x1024. The\nStyleSwin, without complex training strategies, excels over StyleGAN on\nCelebA-HQ 1024, and achieves on-par performance on FFHQ-1024, proving the\npromise of using transformers for high-resolution image generation.

However, although\nvisualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models,\ninternal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely\nopaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to\nunderstand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to\nmore capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose\nVL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting\nthe attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers.\nVL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety\nof statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and\nlanguage components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions\nthrough easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of\nvision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this\npaper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis\nof KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal\ntransformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and\nWebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a\nfew interesting findings about multimodal transformer behaviors that were\nlearned through our tool.",

    "summary": "Relative Positional Encoding (RPE), which encodes the relative distance\nbetween any pair of tokens, is one of the most successful modifications to the\noriginal Transformer. As far as we know, theoretical understanding of the\nRPE-based Transformers is largely unexplored. In this work, we mathematically\nanalyze the power of RPE-based Transformers regarding whether the model is\ncapable of approximating any continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. One may\nnaturally assume the answer is in the affirmative -- RPE-based Transformers are\nuniversal function approximators. However, we present a negative result by\nshowing there exist continuous sequence-to-sequence functions that RPE-based\nTransformers cannot approximate no matter how deep and wide the neural network\nis. One key reason lies in that most RPEs are placed in the softmax attention\nthat always generates a right stochastic matrix. This restricts the network\nfrom capturing positional information in the RPEs and limits its capacity. To\novercome the problem and make the model more powerful, we first present\nsufficient conditions for RPE-based Transformers to achieve universal function\napproximation. With the theoretical guidance, we develop a novel attention\nmodule, called Universal RPE-based (URPE) Attention, which satisfies the\nconditions. Therefore, the corresponding URPE-based Transformers become\nuniversal function approximators.

To address the\ncross-domain issue, a straightforward way is to perform token alignment with\nadversarial training in transformers. However, its performance is often\nunsatisfactory as the tokens in detection transformers are quite diverse and\nrepresent different spatial and semantic information. In this paper, we propose\na new method called Spatial-aware and Semantic-aware Token Alignment (SSTA) for\ncross-domain detection transformers. In particular, we take advantage of the\ncharacteristics of cross-attention as used in detection transformer and propose\nthe spatial-aware token alignment (SpaTA) and the semantic-aware token\nalignment (SemTA) strategies to guide the token alignment across domains. For\nspatial-aware token alignment, we can extract the information from the\ncross-attention map (CAM) to align the distribution of tokens according to\ntheir attention to object queries. For semantic-aware token alignment, we\ninject the category information into the cross-attention map and construct\ndomain embedding to guide the learning of a multi-class discriminator so as to\nmodel the category relationship and achieve category-level token alignment\nduring the entire adaptation process.

However, the most popular convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) based methods for medical image segmentation are imperfect because they\nmodel long-range dependencies by stacking layers or enlarging filters.\nTransformers and the self-attention mechanism are recently proposed to\neffectively learn long-range dependencies by modeling all pairs of word-to-word\nattention regardless of their positions. The idea has also been extended to the\ncomputer vision field by creating and treating image patches as embeddings.\nConsidering the computation complexity for whole image self-attention, current\ntransformer-based models settle for a rigid partitioning scheme that\npotentially loses informative relations. Besides, current medical transformers\nmodel global context on full resolution images, leading to unnecessary\ncomputation costs.

Recently, Transformer has been gaining popularity due to\nits parallel computing ability for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Thus, it\nseems to be straightforward to apply the vision Transformer to solve VSR.\nHowever, the typical block design of Transformer with a fully connected\nself-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer does not fit well for\nVSR due to the following two reasons. First, the fully connected self-attention\nlayer neglects to exploit the data locality because this layer relies on linear\nlayers to compute attention maps. Second, the token-wise feed-forward layer\nlacks the feature alignment which is important for VSR since this layer\nindependently processes each of the input token embeddings without any\ninteraction among them. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt\nTransformer for VSR.

    "title": "Transformers are Universal In-context Learners",
    "summary": "Transformers are deep architectures that define \"in-context mappings\" which\nenable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt\nin NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In this\nwork, we study in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an\narbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly\naddress their expressivity, we consider the case that the mappings are\nconditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens\nwhich becomes discrete for a finite number of these. The relevant notion of\nsmoothness then corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance\nbetween these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and\ncan approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision,\nuniformly over compact token domains. A key aspect of our results, compared to\nexisting findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can\noperate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it\noperates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not\nincrease with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the\ndimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also\nexplicitly controlled. We consider both unmasked attentions (as used for the\nvision transformer) and masked causal attentions (as used for NLP and time\nseries applications). We tackle the causal setting leveraging a space-time\nlifting to analyze causal attention as a mapping over probability distributions\nof tokens.",

    "summary": "Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) outperform regular GNNs by\nincorporating time information into graph-based operations. However, TGNNs\nadopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored\ntraining frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN,\nwhich uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy\nTransformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer\nachieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community\ndeveloped high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient\nattention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP,\nDeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling,\ni.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes\nand their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling.\nBeside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs\nincluding suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal\nmasking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems\nare slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As\nsuch, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph\nsampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with\nmultiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art\nTGNN training frameworks.

    "summary": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nvarious computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However,\nTransformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for\nexplainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific\ninquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional\nfeature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant\ncomputational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention\nAttribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ\nfrom traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial\nfeatures or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers\nboth spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in\nTransformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark\ncollection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We\nintroduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to\nenhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention\nfocusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations,\nresulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In\nterms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\\% of the\ncomputational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for\nreal-time video XAI analysis applications.

    "summary": "The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to\nproduce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine\nlearning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\n$L$-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we\nidentify that the Lipschitz constant $L$ of nonlinear function classes as a key\nfactor governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging\nthese insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether $L$ is below or\nabove a threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero\nprediction error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the\nunderlying task functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to\nprompt tokens with highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the\nICL capability of transformers for unseen functions.",

Recently, machine learning (ML) based approaches have emerged as\npromising alternatives to traditional multiscale methods.

The recent advancements in\nattention-based Transformer architectures open the door to a more powerful\nclass of surrogate models. Attention mechanism has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in natural language processing and computer vision. In this work,\nwe introduce a surrogate (meta) model, namely ViT-Transformer, using a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) encoder and a Transformer-based decoder which are both driven\nby the self-attention mechanism. The ViT encoder extracts microstructural\nfeatures from material images, while the decoder is a masked Transformer\nencoder that combines the latent geometrical features with the macroscopic\nstrain input sequence to predict the corresponding stress response. To enhance\ntraining, we propose a random extract training algorithm that improves\nrobustness to sequences of variable length. We design and construct a compact\nyet diverse dataset via data augmentation, and validate the surrogate model\nusing various composite material images and loading scenarios.

However,\ntransformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention\nmodule (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which\nseverely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is\ncritical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under\nhigh request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.\n  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with\nlinear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent\ncomputation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we\nintroduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer\nattention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.\nThese models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained\nreasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing\nless critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.\n  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with\ndifferent SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as\nmore Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant\nof Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,\nachieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the\nproduction-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning\nperformance.

    "summary": "The self-attention module is a key component of Transformer-based models,\nwherein each token pays attention to every other token. Recent studies have\nshown that these heads exhibit syntactic, semantic, or local behaviour. Some\nstudies have also identified promise in restricting this attention to be local,\ni.e., a token attending to other tokens only in a small neighbourhood around\nit. However, no conclusive evidence exists that such local attention alone is\nsufficient to achieve high accuracy on multiple NLP tasks. In this work, we\nsystematically analyse the role of locality information in learnt models and\ncontrast it with the role of syntactic information. More specifically, we first\ndo a sensitivity analysis and show that, at every layer, the representation of\na token is much more sensitive to tokens in a small neighborhood around it than\nto tokens which are syntactically related to it. We then define an attention\nbias metric to determine whether a head pays more attention to local tokens or\nto syntactically related tokens. We show that a larger fraction of heads have a\nlocality bias as compared to a syntactic bias. Having established the\nimportance of local attention heads, we train and evaluate models where varying\nfractions of the attention heads are constrained to be local. Such models would\nbe more efficient as they would have fewer computations in the attention layer.\nWe evaluate these models on 4 GLUE datasets (QQP, SST-2, MRPC, QNLI) and 2 MT\ndatasets (En-De, En-Ru) and clearly demonstrate that such constrained models\nhave comparable performance to the unconstrained models.

    "summary": "Transformer with self-attention has led to the revolutionizing of natural\nlanguage processing field, and recently inspires the emergence of\nTransformer-style architecture design with competitive results in numerous\ncomputer vision tasks. Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ\nself-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on\npairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich\ncontexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel\nTransformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual\nrecognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among\ninput keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus\nstrengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first\ncontextually encodes input keys via a $3\\times3$ convolution, leading to a\nstatic contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded\nkeys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix\nthrough two consecutive $1\\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is\nmultiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of\ninputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are\nfinally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can\nreadily replace each $3\\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a\nTransformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet).\nThrough extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image\nrecognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the\nsuperiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone.

    "summary": "At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not\nwell understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that\ntraining Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to\ngradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple\nweight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced\nby 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a\nregression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when\ntraining self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the\nmodels learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the\nweights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained\nTransformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in\ntheir forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression\nproblems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context\nlearning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore\nidentify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by\nlearning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data\nrepresentations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss\nintriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context\nlearning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be\nunderstood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent\nlearning within Transformers.

    "summary": "This study delves into the effectiveness of various learning methods in\nimproving Transformer models, focusing particularly on the Gated Residual\nNetwork Transformer (GRN-Transformer) in the context of pediatric intensive\ncare units (PICU) with limited data availability. Our findings indicate that\nTransformers trained via supervised learning are less effective compared to\nMLP, CNN, and LSTM networks in such environments. Yet, leveraging unsupervised\nand self-supervised learning on unannotated data, with subsequent fine-tuning\non annotated data, notably enhances Transformer performance, although not to\nthe level of the GRN-Transformer. Central to our research is the analysis of\ndifferent activation functions for the Gated Linear Unit (GLU), a crucial\nelement of the GRN structure. We also employ Mutual Information Neural\nEstimation (MINE) to evaluate the GRN's contribution. Additionally, the study\nexamines the effects of integrating GRN within the Transformer's Attention\nmechanism versus using it as a separate intermediary layer. Our results\nhighlight that GLU with sigmoid activation stands out, achieving 0.98 accuracy,\n0.91 precision, 0.96 recall, and 0.94 F1 score. The MINE analysis supports the\nhypothesis that GRN enhances the mutual information between the hidden\nrepresentations and the output. Moreover, the use of GRN as an intermediate\nfilter layer proves more beneficial than incorporating it within the Attention\nmechanism. In summary, this research clarifies how GRN bolsters\nGRN-Transformer's performance, surpassing other learning techniques. These\nfindings offer a promising avenue for adopting sophisticated models like\nTransformers in data-constrained environments, such as PPG artifact detection\nin PICU settings.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel knowledge distillation neural architecture\nleveraging efficient transformer networks for effective image classification.\nNatural images display intricate arrangements encompassing numerous extraneous\nelements. Vision transformers utilize localized patches to compute attention.\nHowever, exclusive dependence on patch segmentation proves inadequate in\nsufficiently encompassing the comprehensive nature of the image. To address\nthis issue, we have proposed an inner-outer transformer-based architecture,\nwhich gives attention to the global and local aspects of the image. Moreover,\nThe training of transformer models poses significant challenges due to their\ndemanding resource, time, and data requirements. To tackle this, we integrate\nknowledge distillation into the architecture, enabling efficient learning.\nLeveraging insights from a larger teacher model, our approach enhances learning\nefficiency and effectiveness. Significantly, the transformer-in-transformer\nnetwork acquires lightweight characteristics by means of distillation conducted\nwithin the feature extraction layer. Our featured network's robustness is\nestablished through substantial experimentation on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and\nCIFAR100 datasets, demonstrating commendable top-1 and top-5 accuracy.

    "summary": "The general trend in NLP is towards increasing model capacity and performance\nvia deeper neural networks. However, simply stacking more layers of the popular\nTransformer architecture for machine translation results in poor convergence\nand high computational overhead. Our empirical analysis suggests that\nconvergence is poor due to gradient vanishing caused by the interaction between\nresidual connections and layer normalization. We propose depth-scaled\ninitialization (DS-Init), which decreases parameter variance at the\ninitialization stage, and reduces output variance of residual connections so as\nto ease gradient back-propagation through normalization layers. To address\ncomputational cost, we propose a merged attention sublayer (MAtt) which\ncombines a simplified averagebased self-attention sublayer and the\nencoderdecoder attention sublayer on the decoder side. Results on WMT and IWSLT\ntranslation tasks with five translation directions show that deep Transformers\nwith DS-Init and MAtt can substantially outperform their base counterpart in\nterms of BLEU (+1.1 BLEU on average for 12-layer models), while matching the\ndecoding speed of the baseline model thanks to the efficiency improvements of\nMAtt.",

We utilize a relation\nattention module to capture the dependencies of feature maps and a parallel\nattention module to decode all characters in parallel, which make our method\nmore effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on several public\nbenchmarks as well as our collected multi-line text dataset show that our\napproach is effective to recognize regular and irregular scene text and\noutperforms previous methods both in accuracy and speed.",

    "summary": "Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown\nto be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,\nit is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the\nTransformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand,\ndedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical\nstructures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we\nattempt to bridge this gap with \"Hierarchical Accumulation\" to encode parse\ntree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach\noutperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14\nEnglish-German translation task. It also yields improvements over Transformer\nand Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that\nusing hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model\nprefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.",

LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear\ncomputation complexity and a logarithm dependency between any two tokens in a\nsequence; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long\nsequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard\nattention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing\nTransformer-based optimization.

    "title": "Transformer Normalisation Layers and the Independence of Semantic\n  Subspaces",
    "summary": "Recent works have shown that transformers can solve contextual reasoning\ntasks by internally executing computational graphs called circuits. Circuits\noften use attention to logically match information from subspaces of the\nrepresentation, e.g. using position-in-sequence to identify the previous token.\nIn this work, we consider a semantic subspace to be any independent subspace of\nthe latent representation that can fully determine an attention distribution.\nWe show that Pre-Norm, the placement of normalisation layer used by\nstate-of-the-art transformers, violates this ability unless the model learns a\nstrict representation structure of orthogonal spheres. This is because it\ncauses linear subspaces to interfere through their common normalisation factor.\nTheoretically, we analyse circuit stability by modelling this interference as\nrandom noise on the $L_2$-norms of the query/key/value vectors, predicting a\nphenomenon of circuit collapse when sparse-attention shifts to a different\ntoken. Empirically, we investigate the sensitivity of real-world models trained\nfor mathematical addition, observing a 1% rate of circuit collapse when the\nnorms are artificially perturbed by $\\lesssim$10%. We contrast Pre-Norm with\nQKV-Norm, which places normalisation after the attention head's linear\noperators. Theoretically this relaxes the representational constraints.\nEmpirically we observe comparable in-distribution but worse out-of-distribution\nperformance.",

    "summary": "Facial expression recognition (FER) has received considerable attention in\ncomputer vision, with \"in-the-wild\" environments such as human-computer\ninteraction. However, FER images contain uncertainties such as occlusion, low\nresolution, pose variation, illumination variation, and subjectivity, which\nincludes some expressions that do not match the target label. Consequently,\nlittle information is obtained from a noisy single image and it is not trusted.\nThis could significantly degrade the performance of the FER task. To address\nthis issue, we propose a batch transformer (BT), which consists of the proposed\nclass batch attention (CBA) module, to prevent overfitting in noisy data and\nextract trustworthy information by training on features reflected from several\nimages in a batch, rather than information from a single image. We also propose\nmulti-level attention (MLA) to prevent overfitting the specific features by\ncapturing correlations between each level. In this paper, we present a batch\ntransformer network (BTN) that combines the above proposals. Experimental\nresults on various FER benchmark datasets show that the proposed BTN\nconsistently outperforms the state-ofthe-art in FER datasets. Representative\nresults demonstrate the promise of the proposed BTN for FER.",

    "summary": "We study two strange phenomena in auto-regressive Transformers: (1) the\ndominance of the first token in attention heads; (2) the occurrence of large\noutlier activations in the hidden states. We find that popular large language\nmodels, such as Llama attend maximally to the first token in 98% of attention\nheads, a behaviour we attribute to the softmax function. To mitigate this\nissue, we propose a reformulation of softmax to softmax-1. Furthermore, we\nidentify adaptive optimisers, e.g. Adam, as the primary contributor to the\nlarge outlier activations and introduce OrthoAdam, a novel optimiser that\nutilises orthogonal matrices to transform gradients, to address this issue.\nFinally, not only do our methods prevent these phenomena from occurring, but\nadditionally, they enable Transformers to sustain their performance when\nquantised using basic algorithms, something that standard methods are unable to\ndo. In summary, our methods reduce the attention proportion on the first token\nfrom 65% to 3.3%, the activation kurtosis in the hidden states from 1657 to\n3.1, and perplexity penalty under 4-bit weight quantisation from 3565 to 0.3.",

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both\nmodel size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models\nrequires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling\nlaws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound\nsettings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive\ninternet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming\nless valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize\ntoken efficiency.\n  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an\narchitecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear\nfunctions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate\nthat the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than\nstandard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models\noutperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,\ncoding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that\n$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge\nand reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.",

Recent works have widely applied the\ntransformer-based language models and significantly improved their\neffectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, an inherent issue has remained\nneglected: the attention of individual heads in the transformer will be diluted\nor powerless while feeding the long non-punctuation utterances. Since those\nprevious contexts, not the followings, are comparatively more valuable to the\ncurrent position, it's hard to achieve a good balance by independent attention.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Feature Fusion framework based on two-type\nAttentions (FFA) to alleviate the shortage.

Vision Transformers (ViT) recently\nachieve remarkable performance in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). Previous\nworks mainly focus on block design and model expansion for ViTs.

Since the low-level\nlocal information is crucial to the transferability of the representation, it\nis beneficial to preserve the locality in attention layers. In this paper, we\nencourage the model to preserve more local information as the training\nprocedure goes on and devise a Locality-Preserved Attention (LPA) layer to\nemphasize the importance of local features.

Existing studies either focus on the encoder part, which cannot be\ndeployed on sequence-to-sequence generation tasks, e.g., Machine Translation\n(MT), or suffer from a significant performance drop. In this work, we keep the\ntranslation performance while gaining 20\\% speed up by introducing extra\nselection layer based on lightweight attention that selects a small portion of\ntokens to be attended. It takes advantage of the original attention to ensure\nperformance and dimension reduction to accelerate inference. Experimental\nresults show that our method could achieve up to 95\\% sparsity (only 5\\% tokens\nattended) approximately, and save 93\\% computation cost on the attention module\ncompared with the original Transformer, while maintaining the performance.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based models, even though achieving super-human performance on\nseveral downstream tasks, are often regarded as a black box and used as a\nwhole. It is still unclear what mechanisms they have learned, especially their\ncore module: multi-head attention. Inspired by functional specialization in the\nhuman brain, which helps to efficiently handle multiple tasks, this work\nattempts to figure out whether the multi-head attention module will evolve\nsimilar function separation under multi-tasking training. If it is, can this\nmechanism further improve the model performance? To investigate these\nquestions, we introduce an interpreting method to quantify the degree of\nfunctional specialization in multi-head attention. We further propose a simple\nmulti-task training method to increase functional specialization and mitigate\nnegative information transfer in multi-task learning. Experimental results on\nseven pre-trained transformer models have demonstrated that multi-head\nattention does evolve functional specialization phenomenon after multi-task\ntraining which is affected by the similarity of tasks. Moreover, the multi-task\ntraining strategy based on functional specialization boosts performance in both\nmulti-task learning and transfer learning without adding any parameters.",

TokenShift, a recent\nmodel based on Vision Transformer (ViT), also uses the temporal feature shift\nmechanism, which, however, does not fully exploit the structure of Multi-head\nSelf-Attention (MSA) in ViT. In this paper, we propose Multi-head\nSelf/Cross-Attention (MSCA), which fully utilizes the attention structure.\nTokenShift is based on a frame-wise ViT with features temporally shifted with\nsuccessive frames (at time t+1 and t-1). In contrast, the proposed MSCA\nreplaces MSA in the frame-wise ViT, and some MSA heads attend to successive\nframes instead of the current frame. The computation cost is the same as the\nframe-wise ViT and TokenShift as it simply changes the target to which the\nattention is taken. There is a choice about which of key, query, and value are\ntaken from the successive frames, then we experimentally compared these\nvariants with Kinetics400. We also investigate other variants in which the\nproposed MSCA is used along the patch dimension of ViT, instead of the head\ndimension. Experimental results show that a variant, MSCA-KV, shows the best\nperformance and is better than TokenShift by 0.1% and then ViT by 1.2%.",

    "summary": "Attention within windows has been widely explored in vision transformers to\nbalance the performance, computation complexity, and memory footprint. However,\ncurrent models adopt a hand-crafted fixed-size window design, which restricts\ntheir capacity of modeling long-term dependencies and adapting to objects of\ndifferent sizes. To address this drawback, we propose\n\\textbf{V}aried-\\textbf{S}ize Window \\textbf{A}ttention (VSA) to learn adaptive\nwindow configurations from data. Specifically, based on the tokens within each\ndefault window, VSA employs a window regression module to predict the size and\nlocation of the target window, i.e., the attention area where the key and value\ntokens are sampled. By adopting VSA independently for each attention head, it\ncan model long-term dependencies, capture rich context from diverse windows,\nand promote information exchange among overlapped windows. VSA is an\neasy-to-implement module that can replace the window attention in\nstate-of-the-art representative models with minor modifications and negligible\nextra computational cost while improving their performance by a large margin,\ne.g., 1.1\\% for Swin-T on ImageNet classification. In addition, the performance\ngain increases when using larger images for training and test. Experimental\nresults on more downstream tasks, including object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and semantic segmentation, further demonstrate the superiority of\nVSA over the vanilla window attention in dealing with objects of different\nsizes.

Neural machine translation based on the attention mechanism is\nparallelizable and addresses the problem of handling long-range dependencies\namong words in sentences more effectively than recurrent neural networks. One\nof the key concepts in attention is to learn three matrices, query, key, and\nvalue, where global dependencies among words are learned through linearly\nprojecting word embeddings through these matrices.

To this end, we propose to analyze and\nredesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement.\nSpecifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in\nmulti-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature\ninto channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into\nseveral groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial\nselfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict\nand mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned\nchannel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network\n(TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities.\nFurthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN\ninto smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining\nperformance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show\nthat TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable\nperformance against state-of-theart SSID methods.",

    "summary": "The accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for diagnosing and\ntreating diseases. Recent studies demonstrate that vision transformer-based\nmethods have significantly improved performance in medical image segmentation,\nprimarily due to their superior ability to establish global relationships among\nfeatures and adaptability to various inputs. However, these methods struggle\nwith the low signal-to-noise ratio inherent to medical images. Additionally,\nthe effective utilization of channel and spatial information, which are\nessential for medical image segmentation, is limited by the representation\ncapacity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose a\nmulti-dimension transformer with attention-based filtering (MDT-AF), which\nredesigns the patch embedding and self-attention mechanism for medical image\nsegmentation. MDT-AF incorporates an attention-based feature filtering\nmechanism into the patch embedding blocks and employs a coarse-to-fine process\nto mitigate the impact of low signal-to-noise ratio. To better capture complex\nstructures in medical images, MDT-AF extends the self-attention mechanism to\nincorporate spatial and channel dimensions, enriching feature representation.\nMoreover, we introduce an interaction mechanism to improve the feature\naggregation between spatial and channel dimensions. Experimental results on\nthree public medical image segmentation benchmarks show that MDT-AF achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

Here, we consider a deep multi-head\nself-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet\nanalytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian\nlearning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor\nstatistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e.,\n$N,P\\rightarrow\\infty$, $P/N=\\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width\nand $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor\nstatistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing\ndifferent 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different\nattention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a\n'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with\nthe task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths\nenhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both\nsynthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory\nexplicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the\nlearned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models\ntrained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient\nsize reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed\nless relevant by our theory.",

    "summary": "Image captioning is the generation of natural language descriptions of images\nwhich have increased immense popularity in the recent past. With this different\ndeep-learning techniques are devised for the development of factual and\nstylized image captioning models. Previous models focused more on the\ngeneration of factual and stylized captions separately providing more than one\ncaption for a single image. The descriptions generated from these suffer from\nout-of-vocabulary and repetition issues. To the best of our knowledge, no such\nwork exists that provided a description that integrates different captioning\nmethods to describe the contents of an image with factual and stylized\n(romantic and humorous) elements. To overcome these limitations, this paper\npresents a novel Unified Attention and Multi-Head Attention-driven Caption\nSummarization Transformer (UnMA-CapSumT) based Captioning Framework. It\nutilizes both factual captions and stylized captions generated by the Modified\nAdaptive Attention-based factual image captioning model (MAA-FIC) and Style\nFactored Bi-LSTM with attention (SF-Bi-ALSTM) driven stylized image captioning\nmodel respectively. SF-Bi-ALSTM-based stylized IC model generates two prominent\nstyles of expression- {romance, and humor}. The proposed summarizer UnMHA-ST\ncombines both factual and stylized descriptions of an input image to generate\nstyled rich coherent summarized captions.

In this paper, we propose to improve MHA by\nexploring diverse learners and introducing various interactions between heads,\nwhich results in a Hierarchical multI-head atteNtion driven Transformer model,\ntermed HINT, for image restoration.

Through the development of ConvShareViT, the\nbehaviour of convolutions within MHSA and their effectiveness in learning the\nattention mechanism were analysed systematically.

To address this\ngap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods\nat varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse\ncollection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural\nlanguage while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our\nexperiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis\nreveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are\npreferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while\nstatistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than\nprefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear\nstrategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of\nsparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios.

An intuitive\nsolution is ``coupling'' the CAM with the long-range attention matrix of visual\ntransformers (ViT) We find that the direct ``coupling'', e.g., pixel-wise\nmultiplication of attention and activation, achieves a more global coverage (on\nthe foreground), but unfortunately goes with a great increase of false\npositives, i.e., background pixels are mistakenly included. This paper aims to\ntackle this issue. It proposes a new method to couple CAM and Attention matrix\nin a probabilistic Diffusion way, and dub it AD-CAM. Intuitively, it integrates\nViT attention and CAM activation in a conservative and convincing way.\nConservative is achieved by refining the attention between a pair of pixels\nbased on their respective attentions to common neighbors, where the intuition\nis two pixels having very different neighborhoods are rarely dependent, i.e.,\ntheir attention should be reduced.

    "title": "Towards Understanding Cross and Self-Attention in Stable Diffusion for\n  Text-Guided Image Editing",
    "summary": "Deep Text-to-Image Synthesis (TIS) models such as Stable Diffusion have\nrecently gained significant popularity for creative Text-to-image generation.\nYet, for domain-specific scenarios, tuning-free Text-guided Image Editing (TIE)\nis of greater importance for application developers, which modify objects or\nobject properties in images by manipulating feature components in attention\nlayers during the generation process. However, little is known about what\nsemantic meanings these attention layers have learned and which parts of the\nattention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper, we\nconduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps\nin Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information that can\nresult in editing failures. In contrast, self-attention maps play a crucial\nrole in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during\nthe transformation to the target image. Our analysis offers valuable insights\ninto understanding cross and self-attention maps in diffusion models. Moreover,\nbased on our findings, we simplify popular image editing methods and propose a\nmore straightforward yet more stable and efficient tuning-free procedure that\nonly modifies self-attention maps of the specified attention layers during the\ndenoising process. Experimental results show that our simplified method\nconsistently surpasses the performance of popular approaches on multiple\ndatasets.",

    "summary": "We present a method for classifying the expertise of a pathologist based on\nhow they allocated their attention during a cancer reading. We engage this\ndecoding task by developing a novel method for predicting the attention of\npathologists as they read whole-slide Images (WSIs) of prostate and make cancer\ngrade classifications. Our ground truth measure of a pathologists' attention is\nthe x, y and z (magnification) movement of their viewport as they navigated\nthrough WSIs during readings, and to date we have the attention behavior of 43\npathologists reading 123 WSIs. These data revealed that specialists have higher\nagreement in both their attention and cancer grades compared to general\npathologists and residents, suggesting that sufficient information may exist in\ntheir attention behavior to classify their expertise level. To attempt this, we\ntrained a transformer-based model to predict the visual attention heatmaps of\nresident, general, and specialist (GU) pathologists during Gleason grading.\nBased solely on a pathologist's attention during a reading, our model was able\nto predict their level of expertise with 75.3%, 56.1%, and 77.2% accuracy,\nrespectively, better than chance and baseline models. Our model therefore\nenables a pathologist's expertise level to be easily and objectively evaluated,\nimportant for pathology training and competency assessment.

    "title": "Sigmoid Self-Attention has Lower Sample Complexity than Softmax\n  Self-Attention: A Mixture-of-Experts Perspective",
    "summary": "At the core of the popular Transformer architecture is the self-attention\nmechanism, which dynamically assigns softmax weights to each input token so\nthat the model can focus on the most salient information. However, the softmax\nstructure slows down the attention computation due to its row-wise nature, and\nit inherently introduces competition among tokens: as the weight assigned to\none token increases, the weights of others decrease. This competitive dynamic\nmay narrow the focus of self-attention to a limited set of features,\npotentially overlooking other informative characteristics. Recent experimental\nstudies have shown that using the element-wise sigmoid function helps eliminate\ntoken competition and reduce the computational overhead. Despite these\npromising empirical results, a rigorous comparison between sigmoid and softmax\nself-attention mechanisms remains absent in the literature. This paper closes\nthis gap by theoretically demonstrating that sigmoid self-attention is more\nsample-efficient than its softmax counterpart. Toward that goal, we represent\nthe self-attention matrix as a mixture of experts and show that ``experts'' in\nsigmoid self-attention require significantly less data to achieve the same\napproximation error as those in softmax self-attention.",

This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to\naddress this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in\npretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D\nwindows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA\neliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise\nsliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel\nhardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being\nhardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the\nfirst efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving\n58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over\nFlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading\nvideo DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s\nwithout quality degradation, requiring no training.

While various sparse attention methods have been\nproposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not\noptimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video\ndata when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block\nAttention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for\nVDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within\npre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality,\nvarying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA\nenhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a\nlayer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to\ndiverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global\nblock selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions\nacross an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to\ndynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative\nsimilarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly\naccelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and\n1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation\nquality to full attention.

However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer\narchitecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing\nlong sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising\nsolution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters\nand disrupt the conventional \\textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long}\nworkflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention\nframework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that\nseamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2\nreuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture\nmodification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence\nprocessing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all\nsequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly\ntransitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical\nacceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2\nthat significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on\nlong-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that\nInfLLM-V2 is 4$\\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and\n99.7% of the performance, respectively.

    "summary": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have been successfully applied in image\nclassification tasks recently. In this paper, we show that, unlike convolution\nneural networks (CNNs)that can be improved by stacking more convolutional\nlayers, the performance of ViTs saturate fast when scaled to be deeper. More\nspecifically, we empirically observe that such scaling difficulty is caused by\nthe attention collapse issue: as the transformer goes deeper, the attention\nmaps gradually become similar and even much the same after certain layers. In\nother words, the feature maps tend to be identical in the top layers of deep\nViT models. This fact demonstrates that in deeper layers of ViTs, the\nself-attention mechanism fails to learn effective concepts for representation\nlearning and hinders the model from getting expected performance gain. Based on\nabove observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, named\nRe-attention, to re-generate the attention maps to increase their diversity at\ndifferent layers with negligible computation and memory cost. The pro-posed\nmethod makes it feasible to train deeper ViT models with consistent performance\nimprovements via minor modification to existing ViT models.

    "summary": "Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is an\nimportant and challenging task. Due to the high training efficiency, end-to-end\nsolutions for WSSS have received increasing attention from the community.\nHowever, current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks and\nfail to explore the global information properly, thus usually resulting in\nincomplete object regions. In this paper, to address the aforementioned\nproblem, we introduce Transformers, which naturally integrate global\ninformation, to generate more integral initial pseudo labels for end-to-end\nWSSS. Motivated by the inherent consistency between the self-attention in\nTransformers and the semantic affinity, we propose an Affinity from Attention\n(AFA) module to learn semantic affinity from the multi-head self-attention\n(MHSA) in Transformers. The learned affinity is then leveraged to refine the\ninitial pseudo labels for segmentation. In addition, to efficiently derive\nreliable affinity labels for supervising AFA and ensure the local consistency\nof pseudo labels, we devise a Pixel-Adaptive Refinement module that\nincorporates low-level image appearance information to refine the pseudo\nlabels. We perform extensive experiments and our method achieves 66.0% and\n38.9% mIoU on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, respectively,\nsignificantly outperforming recent end-to-end methods and several multi-stage\ncompetitors.

Although a transformer with\nglobal attention achieves significant improvements over CNN for EI depth\nestimation task, it is computationally inefficient, which raises the need for\ntransformer with local attention.

    "summary": "The objective of dense material segmentation is to identify the material\ncategories for every image pixel. Recent studies adopt image patches to extract\nmaterial features. Although the trained networks can improve the segmentation\nperformance, their methods choose a fixed patch resolution which fails to take\ninto account the variation in pixel area covered by each material. In this\npaper, we propose the Dynamic Backward Attention Transformer (DBAT) to\naggregate cross-resolution features. The DBAT takes cropped image patches as\ninput and gradually increases the patch resolution by merging adjacent patches\nat each transformer stage, instead of fixing the patch resolution during\ntraining. We explicitly gather the intermediate features extracted from\ncross-resolution patches and merge them dynamically with predicted attention\nmasks. Experiments show that our DBAT achieves an accuracy of 86.85%, which is\nthe best performance among state-of-the-art real-time models. Like other\nsuccessful deep learning solutions with complex architectures, the DBAT also\nsuffers from lack of interpretability. To address this problem, this paper\nexamines the properties that the DBAT makes use of. By analysing the\ncross-resolution features and the attention weights, this paper interprets how\nthe DBAT learns from image patches. We further align features to semantic\nlabels, performing network dissection, to infer that the proposed model can\nextract material-related features better than other methods.

    "summary": "Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model\ncapabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy\ncomputation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In\nthis paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named\nEfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly\nbounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and\nelement-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with\na sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN\nlayers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication.\nMoreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across\nheads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a\ncascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits\nof the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves\nattention diversity.

In a multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithm following\nthis paradigm, self-attention processing has to deal with intricate image\ntokens including massive information when facing heavy amounts of view input.\nThe curse of information content leads to the extreme difficulty of model\nlearning. To alleviate this problem, recent methods compress the token number\nrepresenting each view or discard the attention operations between the tokens\nfrom different views.

The richness of feature\nlearning is guaranteed by the diversity among different groups. An effective\nand efficient encoder can be established which connects inter-view features\nusing LGA and extract intra-view features using the standard self-attention\nlayer.

    "summary": "Transformers have astounding representational power but typically consume\nconsiderable computation which is quadratic with image resolution. The\nprevailing Swin transformer reduces computational costs through a local window\nstrategy.

To overcome\nthese challenges, we pursue a preferable trade-off between computational cost\nand performance. Accordingly, we propose a novel factorization self-attention\nmechanism (FaSA) that enjoys both the advantages of local window cost and\nlong-range dependency modeling capability. By factorizing the conventional\nattention matrix into sparse sub-attention matrices, FaSA captures long-range\ndependencies while aggregating mixed-grained information at a computational\ncost equivalent to the local window-based self-attention.

In this paper, by reevaluating the\ncross-attention mechanism, we propose an alternate Transformer fusion network\n(ATFusion) to fuse IV images. Our ATFusion consists of one discrepancy\ninformation injection module (DIIM) and two alternate common information\ninjection modules (ACIIM).

In this work, taking inspiration from atrous\nconvolution, we introduce Atrous Attention, a fusion of regional and sparse\nattention, which can adaptively consolidate both local and global information,\nwhile maintaining hierarchical relations. As a further tribute to atrous\nconvolution, we redesign the ubiquitous inverted residual convolution blocks\nwith atrous convolution. Finally, we propose a generalized, hybrid vision\ntransformer backbone, named ACC-ViT, following conventional practices for\nstandard vision tasks. Our tiny version model achieves $\\sim 84 \\%$ accuracy on\nImageNet-1K, with less than $28.5$ million parameters, which is $0.42\\%$\nimprovement over state-of-the-art MaxViT while having $8.4\\%$ less parameters.\nIn addition, we have investigated the efficacy of ACC-ViT backbone under\ndifferent evaluation settings, such as finetuning, linear probing, and\nzero-shot learning on tasks involving medical image analysis, object detection,\nand language-image contrastive learning. ACC-ViT is therefore a strong vision\nbackbone, which is also competitive in mobile-scale versions, ideal for niche\napplications with small datasets.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel Kinematics and Trajectory Prior\nKnowledge-Enhanced Transformer (KTPFormer), which overcomes the weakness in\nexisting transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation that the\nderivation of Q, K, V vectors in their self-attention mechanisms are all based\non simple linear mapping. We propose two prior attention modules, namely\nKinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take\nadvantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion\ntrajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies\nand features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic\nrelationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while\nTPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion\ntrajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the\ntwo modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations\nsimultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M,\nMPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA\nmodules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into\nvarious transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the\nperformance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

    "summary": "Graph Transformers, which incorporate self-attention and positional encoding,\nhave recently emerged as a powerful architecture for various graph learning\ntasks. Despite their impressive performance, the complex non-convex\ninteractions across layers and the recursive graph structure have made it\nchallenging to establish a theoretical foundation for learning and\ngeneralization. This study introduces the first theoretical investigation of a\nshallow Graph Transformer for semi-supervised node classification, comprising a\nself-attention layer with relative positional encoding and a two-layer\nperceptron. Focusing on a graph data model with discriminative nodes that\ndetermine node labels and non-discriminative nodes that are class-irrelevant,\nwe characterize the sample complexity required to achieve a desirable\ngeneralization error by training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This\npaper provides the quantitative characterization of the sample complexity and\nnumber of iterations for convergence dependent on the fraction of\ndiscriminative nodes, the dominant patterns, and the initial model errors.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that self-attention and positional encoding enhance\ngeneralization by making the attention map sparse and promoting the core\nneighborhood during training, which explains the superior feature\nrepresentation of Graph Transformers.

    "summary": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in the fields of computer\nvision and robotics. Recent developments in transformer-based methods have\ndemonstrated enhanced performance in this domain. However, the standard\nattention mechanism utilized in these methods often integrates many\nlow-relevance points, thereby struggling to prioritize its attention weights on\nsparse yet meaningful points. This inefficiency leads to limited local\nstructure modeling capabilities and quadratic computational complexity. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Point Tree Transformer (PTT), a\nnovel transformer-based approach for point cloud registration that efficiently\nextracts comprehensive local and global features while maintaining linear\ncomputational complexity. The PTT constructs hierarchical feature trees from\npoint clouds in a coarse-to-dense manner, and introduces a novel Point Tree\nAttention (PTA) mechanism, which follows the tree structure to facilitate the\nprogressive convergence of attended regions towards salient points.\nSpecifically, each tree layer selectively identifies a subset of key points\nwith the highest attention scores. Subsequent layers focus attention on areas\nof significant relevance, derived from the child points of the selected point\nset. The feature extraction process additionally incorporates coarse point\nfeatures that capture high-level semantic information, thus facilitating local\nstructure modeling and the progressive integration of multiscale information.\nConsequently, PTA empowers the model to concentrate on crucial local structures\nand derive detailed local information while maintaining linear computational\ncomplexity.

However, lacking the built-in\nbias of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for local image statistics, they\nrequire large datasets and modifications to capture relationships between\npatches, especially in segmentation tasks. Images in the frequency domain might\nbe more suitable for the attention mechanism, as local features are represented\nglobally. By transforming images into the frequency domain, local features are\nrepresented globally. Due to MRI data acquisition properties, these images are\nparticularly suitable. This work investigates how the image domain (spatial or\nk-space) affects segmentation results of deep learning (DL) models, focusing on\nattention-based networks and other non-convolutional models based on MLPs. We\nalso examine the necessity of additional positional encoding for\nTransformer-based networks when input images are in the frequency domain. For\nevaluation, we pose a skull stripping task and a brain tissue segmentation\ntask. The attention-based models used are PerceiverIO and a vanilla Transformer\nencoder. To compare with non-attention-based models, an MLP and ResMLP are also\ntrained and tested. Results are compared with the Swin-Unet, the\nstate-of-the-art medical image segmentation model.

    "summary": "The versatility of self-attention mechanism earned transformers great success\nin almost all data modalities, with limitations on the quadratic complexity and\ndifficulty of training. Efficient transformers, on the other hand, often rely\non clever data-modality-dependent construction to get over the quadratic\ncomplexity of transformers. This greatly hinders their applications on\ndifferent data modalities, which is one of the pillars of contemporary\nfoundational modeling. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for efficient\nfoundational modeling by proposing SAMSA - SAMpling-Self-Attention, a\ncontext-aware linear complexity self-attention mechanism that works well on\nmultiple data modalities. Our mechanism is based on a differentiable sampling\nwithout replacement method we discovered. This enables the self-attention\nmodule to attend to the most important token set, where the importance is\ndefined by data. Moreover, as differentiability is not needed in inference, the\nsparse formulation of our method costs little time overhead, further lowering\ncomputational costs. In short, SAMSA achieved competitive or even SOTA results\non many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very\nspecialized models. Against full self-attention, real inference time\nsignificantly decreases while performance ranges from negligible degradation to\noutperformance.

In the literature of studying training\ndynamics of transformers, several simplifications are commonly adopted such as\nweight reparameterization, attention linearization, special initialization, and\nlazy regime. In contrast, we analyze the gradient flow dynamics of\nsimultaneously training three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer from\nrandom initialization, and provide a framework of analyzing such dynamics via a\ncoupled dynamical system. We establish near minimum loss and characterize the\nattention model after training. We discover that gradient flow serves as an\ninherent mechanism that naturally divide the training process into two phases.\nIn Phase 1, the linear MLP quickly aligns with the two target signals for\ncorrect classification, whereas the softmax attention remains almost unchanged.\nIn Phase 2, the attention matrices and the MLP evolve jointly to enlarge the\nclassification margin and reduce the loss to a near minimum value. Technically,\nwe prove a novel property of the gradient flow, termed \\textit{automatic\nbalancing of gradients}, which enables the loss values of different samples to\ndecrease almost at the same rate and further facilitates the proof of near\nminimum training loss.

Despite their remarkable success, these\nempirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations,\nthus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue\nthat there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and\ncompression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully\nattentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the\ninterpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image\nembeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the\nsupervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks\nto find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is\nexpected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and\ncorresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields\ncompact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks.

We derive the general transformation law, describing\nthe change in the self force in terms of the infinitesimal displacement vector\nassociated with the gauge transformation. Based on this transformation law, we\nextend the regularization prescription by Mino et al. and Quinn and Wald\n(originally formulated within the harmonic gauge) to an arbitrary gauge. Then\nwe extend the method of mode-sum regularization (which provides a practical\nmeans for calculating the regularized self force and was recently applied to\nthe harmonic-gauge gravitational self force) to an arbitrary gauge. We find\nthat the regularization parameters involved in this method are\ngauge-independent. We also explore the gauge transformation of the self force\nfrom the harmonic gauge to the Regge-Wheeler gauge and to the radiation gauge,\nfocusing attention on the regularity of these gauge transformations. We\nconclude that the transformation of the self force to the Regge-Wheeler gauge\nin Schwarzschild spacetime is regular for radial orbits and irregular\notherwise, whereas the transformation to the radiation gauge is irregular for\nall orbits.",

    "summary": "It is well believed that Transformer performs better in semantic segmentation\ncompared to convolutional neural networks. Nevertheless, the original Vision\nTransformer may lack of inductive biases of local neighborhoods and possess a\nhigh time complexity. Recently, Swin Transformer sets a new record in various\nvision tasks by using hierarchical architecture and shifted windows while being\nmore efficient. However, as Swin Transformer is specifically designed for image\nclassification, it may achieve suboptimal performance on dense prediction-based\nsegmentation task. Further, simply combing Swin Transformer with existing\nmethods would lead to the boost of model size and parameters for the final\nsegmentation model. In this paper, we rethink the Swin Transformer for semantic\nsegmentation, and design a lightweight yet effective transformer model, called\nSSformer. In this model, considering the inherent hierarchical design of Swin\nTransformer, we propose a decoder to aggregate information from different\nlayers, thus obtaining both local and global attentions. Experimental results\nshow the proposed SSformer yields comparable mIoU performance with\nstate-of-the-art models, while maintaining a smaller model size and lower\ncompute.",

In time series forecasting, the\nautoregressive decoding of canonical Transformer models could introduce huge\naccumulative errors inevitably. Besides, utilizing Transformer to deal with\nspatial-temporal dependencies in the problem still faces tough difficulties.~To\ntackle these limitations, this work is the first attempt to propose a\nNon-Autoregressive Transformer architecture for time series forecasting, aiming\nat overcoming the time delay and accumulative error issues in the canonical\nTransformer. Moreover, we present a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism,\nbuilding a bridge by a learned temporal influence map to fill the gaps between\nthe spatial and temporal attention, so that spatial and temporal dependencies\ncan be processed integrally. Empirically, we evaluate our model on diversified\nego-centric future localization datasets and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance on both real-time and accuracy.",

In\nthis study, we design a mask-series experiment to validate this assumption and\nsubsequently propose the \"Cross-variable Linear Integrated ENhanced Transformer\nfor Multivariate Long-Term Time Series Forecasting\" (Client), an advanced model\nthat outperforms both traditional Transformer-based models and linear models.\nClient employs linear modules to learn trend information and attention modules\nto capture cross-variable dependencies. Meanwhile, it simplifies the embedding\nand position encoding layers and replaces the decoder module with a projection\nlayer. Essentially, Client incorporates non-linearity and cross-variable\ndependencies, which sets it apart from conventional linear models and\nTransformer-based models.

The key innovation in Transformer is a Self-Attention (SA)\nmechanism designed to capture contextual information. However, extending the\noriginal Transformer design to models of greater depth has proven exceedingly\nchallenging, if not impossible. Even though various modifications have been\nproposed in order to stack more layers of SA mechanism into deeper models, a\nfull understanding of this depth problem remains lacking. In this paper, we\nconduct a comprehensive investigation, both theoretically and empirically, to\nsubstantiate the claim that the depth problem is caused by \\emph{token\nsimilarity escalation}; that is, tokens grow increasingly alike after repeated\napplications of the SA mechanism. Our analysis reveals that, driven by the\ninvariant leading eigenspace and large spectral gaps of attention matrices,\ntoken similarity provably escalates at a linear rate. Based on the gained\ninsight, we propose a new strategy of surgically removing excessive similarity\nin contrast to the existing approach of diminishing the SA mechanism explicitly\nor implicitly (such as in pre-norm transformers).

In this study, we consider a sparse linear regression problem\nand investigate how a trained multi-head transformer performs in-context\nlearning. We experimentally discover that the utilization of multi-heads\nexhibits different patterns across layers: multiple heads are utilized and\nessential in the first layer, while usually only a single head is sufficient\nfor subsequent layers. We provide a theoretical explanation for this\nobservation: the first layer preprocesses the context data, and the following\nlayers execute simple optimization steps based on the preprocessed context.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that such a preprocess-then-optimize algorithm can\nsignificantly outperform naive gradient descent and ridge regression\nalgorithms.

Such design explicitly enforces the framework to learn\ndiscriminative domain-specific and domain-invariant representations\nsimultaneously. The proposed method is dubbed CDTrans (cross-domain\ntransformer), and it provides one of the first attempts to solve UDA tasks with\na pure transformer solution. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves\nthe best performance on public UDA datasets, e.g. VisDA-2017 and DomainNet.\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/CDTrans/CDTrans.",

    "summary": "The Transformer and its variants have been proven to be efficient sequence\nlearners in many different domains. Despite their staggering success, a\ncritical issue has been the enormous number of parameters that must be trained\n(ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{11}$) along with the quadratic complexity of\ndot-product attention. In this work, we investigate the problem of\napproximating the two central components of the Transformer -- multi-head\nself-attention and point-wise feed-forward transformation, with reduced\nparameter space and computational complexity. We build upon recent developments\nin analyzing deep neural networks as numerical solvers of ordinary differential\nequations. Taking advantage of an analogy between Transformer stages and the\nevolution of a dynamical system of multiple interacting particles, we formulate\na temporal evolution scheme, TransEvolve, to bypass costly dot-product\nattention over multiple stacked layers. We perform exhaustive experiments with\nTransEvolve on well-known encoder-decoder as well as encoder-only tasks. We\nobserve that the degree of approximation (or inversely, the degree of parameter\nreduction) has different effects on the performance, depending on the task.\nWhile in the encoder-decoder regime, TransEvolve delivers performances\ncomparable to the original Transformer, in encoder-only tasks it consistently\noutperforms Transformer along with several subsequent variants.",

    "summary": "Transformers have outperformed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural\nlanguage generation. But this comes with a significant computational cost, as\nthe attention mechanism's complexity scales quadratically with sequence length.\nEfficient transformer variants have received increasing interest in recent\nworks. Among them, a linear-complexity recurrent variant has proven well suited\nfor autoregressive generation. It approximates the softmax attention with\nrandomized or heuristic feature maps, but can be difficult to train and may\nyield suboptimal accuracy. This work aims to convert a pretrained transformer\ninto its efficient recurrent counterpart, improving efficiency while\nmaintaining accuracy. Specifically, we propose a swap-then-finetune procedure:\nin an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, we replace the softmax attention\nwith its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune. With a\nlearned feature map, our approach provides an improved tradeoff between\nefficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent\nvariants. We also show that the finetuning process has lower training cost\nrelative to training these recurrent variants from scratch. As many models for\nnatural language tasks are increasingly dependent on large-scale pretrained\ntransformers, this work presents a viable approach to improving inference\nefficiency without repeating the expensive pretraining process.",

Besides, these methods directly calculate the pair-wise global\nself-attention equally for all the joints in both the spatial and temporal\ndimensions, undervaluing the effect of discriminative local joints and the\nshort-range temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel Focal and\nGlobal Spatial-Temporal Transformer network (FG-STFormer), that is equipped\nwith two key components: (1) FG-SFormer: focal joints and global parts coupling\nspatial transformer. It forces the network to focus on modelling correlations\nfor both the learned discriminative spatial joints and human body parts\nrespectively. The selective focal joints eliminate the negative effect of\nnon-informative ones during accumulating the correlations. Meanwhile, the\ninteractions between the focal joints and body parts are incorporated to\nenhance the spatial dependencies via mutual cross-attention. (2) FG-TFormer:\nfocal and global temporal transformer. Dilated temporal convolution is\nintegrated into the global self-attention mechanism to explicitly capture the\nlocal temporal motion patterns of joints or body parts, which is found to be\nvital important to make temporal transformer work.

Most FGVC approaches focus on the\nattention mechanism research for discriminative regions mining while neglecting\ntheir interdependencies and composed holistic object structure, which are\nessential for model's discriminative information localization and understanding\nability. To address the above limitations, we propose the Structure Information\nModeling Transformer (SIM-Trans) to incorporate object structure information\ninto transformer for enhancing discriminative representation learning to\ncontain both the appearance information and structure information.\nSpecifically, we encode the image into a sequence of patch tokens and build a\nstrong vision transformer framework with two well-designed modules: (i) the\nstructure information learning (SIL) module is proposed to mine the spatial\ncontext relation of significant patches within the object extent with the help\nof the transformer's self-attention weights, which is further injected into the\nmodel for importing structure information; (ii) the multi-level feature\nboosting (MFB) module is introduced to exploit the complementary of multi-level\nfeatures and contrastive learning among classes to enhance feature robustness\nfor accurate recognition.

    "summary": "Image quality assessment is a fundamental problem in the field of image\nprocessing, and due to the lack of reference images in most practical\nscenarios, no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), has gained\nincreasing attention recently. With the development of deep learning\ntechnology, many deep neural network-based NR-IQA methods have been developed,\nwhich try to learn the image quality based on the understanding of database\ninformation. Currently, Transformer has achieved remarkable progress in various\nvision tasks. Since the characteristics of the attention mechanism in\nTransformer fit the global perceptual impact of artifacts perceived by a human,\nTransformer is thus well suited for image quality assessment tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a Transformer based NR-IQA model using a predicted objective\nerror map and perceptual quality token. Specifically, we firstly generate the\npredicted error map by pre-training one model consisting of a Transformer\nencoder and decoder, in which the objective difference between the distorted\nand the reference images is used as supervision. Then, we freeze the parameters\nof the pre-trained model and design another branch using the vision Transformer\nto extract the perceptual quality token for feature fusion with the predicted\nerror map. Finally, the fused features are regressed to the final image quality\nscore.

Nevertheless, while higher-order graph neural networks have\nbeen reasonably well studied, the exploration of extending graph transformers\nto higher-order variants is just starting. Both theoretical understanding and\nempirical results are limited. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of\nthe theoretical expressive power of order-$k$ graph transformers and sparse\nvariants. We first show that, an order-$k$ graph transformer without additional\nstructural information is less expressive than the $k$-Weisfeiler Lehman\n($k$-WL) test despite its high computational cost. We then explore strategies\nto both sparsify and enhance the higher-order graph transformers, aiming to\nimprove both their efficiency and expressiveness. Indeed, sparsification based\non neighborhood information can enhance the expressive power, as it provides\nadditional information about input graph structures. In particular, we show\nthat a natural neighborhood-based sparse order-$k$ transformer model is not\nonly computationally efficient, but also expressive -- as expressive as $k$-WL\ntest. We further study several other sparse graph attention models that are\ncomputationally efficient and provide their expressiveness analysis.

In this\npaper, we initiate the study of the expressive power of transformer encoders on\nsequences of data (i.e. tuples of numbers). Our results indicate an increase in\nexpressive power of hard attention transformers over data sequences, in stark\ncontrast to the case of strings.

In this work, we\nbridge this gap by providing a fundamental understanding of what distinguishes\nthe Transformer from the other architectures--grounded in a theoretical\ncomparison of the (loss) Hessian. Concretely, for a single self-attention\nlayer, (a) we first entirely derive the Transformer's Hessian and express it in\nmatrix derivatives; (b) we then characterize it in terms of data, weight, and\nattention moment dependencies; and (c) while doing so further highlight the\nimportant structural differences to the Hessian of classical networks.

    "summary": "In exploring Predictive Health Management (PHM) strategies for Proton\nExchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC), the Transformer model, widely used in\ndata-driven approaches, excels in many fields but struggles with time series\nanalysis due to its self-attention mechanism, which yields a complexity of the\ninput sequence squared and low computational efficiency. It also faces\nchallenges in capturing both global long-term dependencies and local details\neffectively. To tackle this, we propose the Temporal Scale Transformer\n(TSTransformer), an enhanced version of the inverted Transformer\n(iTransformer). Unlike traditional Transformers that treat each timestep as an\ninput token, TSTransformer maps sequences of varying lengths into tokens at\ndifferent stages for inter-sequence modeling, using attention to capture\nmultivariate correlations and feed-forward networks (FFN) to encode sequence\nrepresentations. By integrating a one-dimensional convolutional layer into the\nmultivariate attention for multi-level scaling of K and V matrices, it improves\nlocal feature extraction, captures temporal scale characteristics, and reduces\ntoken count and computational costs. Experiments comparing TSTransformer with\nmodels like Long Short-Term Memory, iTransformer, and Transformer demonstrate\nits potential as a powerful tool for advancing PHM in renewable energy,\neffectively addressing the limitations of pure Transformer models in\ndata-driven time series tasks.",

    "summary": "At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix\nto be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often\ndestabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly\nstochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance\nacross different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible\nw.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been\nproven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a\nnovel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue.\nMotivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum\ndoubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the\nself-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the\nexpressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that\nbetter preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple\nsmall-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently\nsurpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic\nTransformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a\nnovel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR\ndecomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows\nimproved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it\nmay mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.",

    "summary": "The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of\nmulti-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks\nwas recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal\nperformance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention\non a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying\nlearning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single\nmatrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to\nsingle-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results\nindicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each\nlabel being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This\nleads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks,\nthereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several\ndistinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy\nbut differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields\nsuperior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on\nhundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is\nachieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer\nblocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage\nlearning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers.

However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs\nare the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based\nlanguage models.

    "summary": "Recently, graph-based and Transformer-based deep learning networks have\ndemonstrated excellent performances on various point cloud tasks. Most of the\nexisting graph methods are based on static graph, which take a fixed input to\nestablish graph relations. Moreover, many graph methods apply maximization and\naveraging to aggregate neighboring features, so that only a single neighboring\npoint affects the feature of centroid or different neighboring points have the\nsame influence on the centroid's feature, which ignoring the correlation and\ndifference between points. Most Transformer-based methods extract point cloud\nfeatures based on global attention and lack the feature learning on local\nneighbors. To solve the problems of these two types of models, we propose a new\nfeature extraction block named Graph Transformer and construct a 3D point point\ncloud learning network called GTNet to learn features of point clouds on local\nand global patterns. Graph Transformer integrates the advantages of graph-based\nand Transformer-based methods, and consists of Local Transformer and Global\nTransformer modules. Local Transformer uses a dynamic graph to calculate all\nneighboring point weights by intra-domain cross-attention with dynamically\nupdated graph relations, so that every neighboring point could affect the\nfeatures of centroid with different weights; Global Transformer enlarges the\nreceptive field of Local Transformer by a global self-attention. In addition,\nto avoid the disappearance of the gradient caused by the increasing depth of\nnetwork, we conduct residual connection for centroid features in GTNet; we also\nadopt the features of centroid and neighbors to generate the local geometric\ndescriptors in Local Transformer to strengthen the local information learning\ncapability of the model.

We study the role of the density of the attention. Our\npreliminary analyses suggest that the spatial interactions of attention maps\nare close to dense interactions rather than sparse ones. This is a curious\nphenomenon, as dense attention maps are harder for the model to learn due to\nsteeper softmax gradients around them. We interpret this as a strong preference\nfor ViT models to include dense interaction. We thus manually insert the\nuniform attention to each layer of ViT models to supply the much needed dense\ninteractions. We call this method Context Broadcasting, CB. We observe that the\ninclusion of CB reduces the degree of density in the original attention maps\nand increases both the capacity and generalizability of the ViT models.

Our approach is\ncompatible with most existing parallelisms (e.g. data parallelism, pipeline\nparallelism and tensor parallelism), which means our sequence parallelism makes\n4D parallelism possible. More importantly, we no longer require a single device\nto hold the whole sequence. That is, with sparse attention, our sequence\nparallelism enables us to train transformer with infinite long sequence.\nSpecifically, we split the input sequence into multiple chunks and feed each\nchunk into its corresponding device (i.e. GPU). To compute the attention\noutput, we integrated ring-style communication with self-attention calculation\nand proposed Ring Self-Attention (RSA). Experiments show that sequence\nparallelism performs well when scaling with batch size and sequence length.\nCompared with tensor parallelism, our approach achieved $13.7\\times$ and\n$3.0\\times$ maximum batch size and sequence length respectively when scaling up\nto 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

    "summary": "Dynamic parameterization of acoustic environments has drawn widespread\nattention in the field of audio processing. Precise representation of local\nroom acoustic characteristics is crucial when designing audio filters for\nvarious audio rendering applications. Key parameters in this context include\nreverberation time (RT60) and geometric room volume. In recent years, neural\nnetworks have been extensively applied in the task of blind room parameter\nestimation. However, there remains a question of whether pure attention\nmechanisms can achieve superior performance in this task. To address this\nissue, this study employs blind room parameter estimation based on monaural\nnoisy speech signals. Various model architectures are investigated, including a\nproposed attention-based model. This model is a convolution-free Audio\nSpectrogram Transformer, utilizing patch splitting, attention mechanisms, and\ncross-modality transfer learning from a pretrained Vision Transformer.\nExperimental results suggest that the proposed attention mechanism-based model,\nrelying purely on attention mechanisms without using convolution, exhibits\nsignificantly improved performance across various room parameter estimation\ntasks, especially with the help of dedicated pretraining and data augmentation\nschemes. Additionally, the model demonstrates more advantageous adaptability\nand robustness when handling variable-length audio inputs compared to existing\nmethods.",

    "summary": "Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight\nnetwork from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data,\noften through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been\nproposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve\nefficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we observe that\ntheir synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real\nsamples are highly aligned. From this observation, we find that aligning\nattention maps of synthetic data helps improve the overall performance of\nquantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise MimiQ, a novel DFQ method\ndesigned for ViTs that enhances inter-head attention similarity. First, we\ngenerate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention outputs from each\nspatial query patch. Then, we align the attention maps of the quantized network\nto those of the full-precision teacher by applying head-wise structural\nattention distillation. The experimental results show that the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for\nViT-DFQ.

    "summary": "Extracting robust feature representation is critical for object\nre-identification to accurately identify objects across non-overlapping\ncameras. Although having a strong representation ability, the Vision\nTransformer (ViT) tends to overfit on most distinct regions of training data,\nlimiting its generalizability and attention to holistic object features.\nMeanwhile, due to the structural difference between CNN and ViT, fine-grained\nstrategies that effectively address this issue in CNN do not continue to be\nsuccessful in ViT. To address this issue, by observing the latent diverse\nrepresentation hidden behind the multi-head attention, we present PartFormer,\nan innovative adaptation of ViT designed to overcome the granularity\nlimitations in object Re-ID tasks. The PartFormer integrates a Head\nDisentangling Block (HDB) that awakens the diverse representation of multi-head\nself-attention without the typical loss of feature richness induced by\nconcatenation and FFN layers post-attention. To avoid the homogenization of\nattention heads and promote robust part-based feature learning, two head\ndiversity constraints are imposed: attention diversity constraint and\ncorrelation diversity constraint. These constraints enable the model to exploit\ndiverse and discriminative feature representations from different attention\nheads. Comprehensive experiments on various object Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate\nthe superiority of the PartFormer. Specifically, our framework significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art by 2.4\\% mAP scores on the most challenging MSMT17\ndataset.",

    "summary": "Despite the success of Transformers, handling long contexts remains\nchallenging due to the limited length generalization and quadratic complexity\nof self-attention. Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger\nattention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context,\nGrouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the\npre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant\ninformation with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence,\nwe split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past\nchunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works\nthat use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to\nlearn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss\nof subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates\nretrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range\ninformation access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs\nduring training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve\nnear-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is\n1000 times the training length.",

For\nexample, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for\ngenerating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency\nissue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy\nwithin video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the\n3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D\nattention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2)\nShorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency\ndistillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and\nperform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step\ngeneration capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to\nconjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities.\nNotably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into\nan efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video\ngeneration with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench.

    "summary": "We study how multi-head softmax attention models are trained to perform\nin-context learning on linear data. Through extensive empirical experiments and\nrigorous theoretical analysis, we demystify the emergence of elegant attention\npatterns: a diagonal and homogeneous pattern in the key-query (KQ) weights, and\na last-entry-only and zero-sum pattern in the output-value (OV) weights.\nRemarkably, these patterns consistently appear from gradient-based training\nstarting from random initialization. Our analysis reveals that such emergent\nstructures enable multi-head attention to approximately implement a debiased\ngradient descent predictor -- one that outperforms single-head attention and\nnearly achieves Bayesian optimality up to proportional factor. Furthermore,\ncompared to linear transformers, the softmax attention readily generalizes to\nsequences longer than those seen during training. We also extend our study to\nscenarios with anisotropic covariates and multi-task linear regression. In the\nformer, multi-head attention learns to implement a form of pre-conditioned\ngradient descent. In the latter, we uncover an intriguing regime where the\ninterplay between head number and task number triggers a superposition\nphenomenon that efficiently resolves multi-task in-context learning.

    "summary": "Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses\nkey-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to\nreduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are\ncomputed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,\neroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose\nTensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the\nlatent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs\nattention independently per shard, and then combines results with an\nall-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while\nunlocking TP efficiency.

TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained\nusing MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient\ntensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal\ntransforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further\nmitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation.

Recently, deep learning methods have become\npopular in this domain. As traffic data are physically associated with road\nnetworks, most proposed models treat it as a spatiotemporal graph modeling\nproblem and use Graph Convolution Network (GCN) based methods. These GCN-based\nmodels highly depend on a predefined and fixed adjacent matrix to reflect the\nspatial dependency. However, the predefined fixed adjacent matrix is limited in\nreflecting the actual dependence of traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel\nmodel, Traffic Transformer, for spatial-temporal graph modeling and long-term\ntraffic forecasting to overcome these limitations. Transformer is the most\npopular framework in Natural Language Processing (NLP). And by adapting it to\nthe spatiotemporal problem, Traffic Transformer hierarchically extracts\nspatiotemporal features through data dynamically by multi-head attention and\nmasked multi-head attention mechanism, and fuse these features for traffic\nforecasting. Furthermore, analyzing the attention weight matrixes can find the\ninfluential part of road networks, allowing us to learn the traffic networks\nbetter.

Attention, in its original formulation, has to be seen\nrather as a human-level tool to explore and/or visualize relevancy scores in\nsequential data. However, the way how it is constructed leads to significant\ncomputational complexity. Instead, we present SimpleTRON: Simple Transformer\nwith O(N) Complexity, a simple and fast alternative without any approximation\nthat, unlike other approximation models, does not have any architecture-related\noverhead and therefore can be seen as a purely linear Transformer-like model.\nThis architecture, to the best of our knowledge, outperforms existing\nsub-quadratic attention approximation models on several tasks from the\nLong-Range Arena benchmark. Moreover, we show, that SimpleTRON can benefit from\nweight transfer from pretrained large language models, as its parameters can be\nfully transferable.",

Some protein language models, including MSA\nTransformer and AlphaFold's EvoFormer, take multiple sequence alignments (MSAs)\nof evolutionarily related proteins as inputs. Simple combinations of MSA\nTransformer's row attentions have led to state-of-the-art unsupervised\nstructural contact prediction. We demonstrate that similarly simple, and\nuniversal, combinations of MSA Transformer's column attentions strongly\ncorrelate with Hamming distances between sequences in MSAs. Therefore,\nMSA-based language models encode detailed phylogenetic relationships. We\nfurther show that these models can separate coevolutionary signals encoding\nfunctional and structural constraints from phylogenetic correlations reflecting\nhistorical contingency. To assess this, we generate synthetic MSAs, either\nwithout or with phylogeny, from Potts models trained on natural MSAs.

This may not be ideal\nsince the localization ability to delineate accurate object boundaries, is most\nprominent in the lower, high-resolution feature maps, while the semantics that\ncan disambiguate image signals belonging to one object vs. another, typically\nemerges in a higher level of processing. We present Hierarchical Inter-Level\nAttention (HILA), an attention-based method that captures Bottom-Up and\nTop-Down Updates between features of different levels. HILA extends\nhierarchical vision transformer architectures by adding local connections\nbetween features of higher and lower levels to the backbone encoder. In each\niteration, we construct a hierarchy by having higher-level features compete for\nassignments to update lower-level features belonging to them, iteratively\nresolving object-part relationships. These improved lower-level features are\nthen used to re-update the higher-level features. HILA can be integrated into\nthe majority of hierarchical architectures without requiring any changes to the\nbase model. We add HILA into SegFormer and the Swin Transformer and show\nnotable improvements in accuracy in semantic segmentation with fewer parameters\nand FLOPS.

    "summary": "Understanding the dynamic nature of protein structures is essential for\ncomprehending their biological functions. While significant progress has been\nmade in predicting static folded structures, modeling protein motions on\nmicrosecond to millisecond scales remains challenging. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Protein\nTransformer with Scattering, Attention, and Positional Embedding (ProtSCAPE),\nwhich leverages the geometric scattering transform alongside transformer-based\nattention mechanisms to capture protein dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. ProtSCAPE utilizes the multi-scale nature of the geometric\nscattering transform to extract features from protein structures conceptualized\nas graphs and integrates these features with dual attention structures that\nfocus on residues and amino acid signals, generating latent representations of\nprotein trajectories. Furthermore, ProtSCAPE incorporates a regression head to\nenforce temporally coherent latent representations.",

    "summary": "Transductive tasks on graphs differ fundamentally from typical supervised\nmachine learning tasks, as the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nassumption does not hold among samples. Instead, all train/test/validation\nsamples are present during training, making them more akin to a semi-supervised\ntask. These differences make the analysis of the models substantially different\nfrom other models. Recently, Graph Transformers have significantly improved\nresults on these datasets by overcoming long-range dependency problems.\nHowever, the quadratic complexity of full Transformers has driven the community\nto explore more efficient variants, such as those with sparser attention\npatterns. While the attention matrix has been extensively discussed, the hidden\ndimension or width of the network has received less attention. In this work, we\nestablish some theoretical bounds on how and under what conditions the hidden\ndimension of these networks can be compressed. Our results apply to both sparse\nand dense variants of Graph Transformers.",

    "summary": "The application of transformer-based models on time series forecasting (TSF)\ntasks has long been popular to study. However, many of these works fail to beat\nthe simple linear residual model, and the theoretical understanding of this\nissue is still limited. In this work, we propose the first theoretical\nexplanation of the inefficiency of transformers on TSF tasks. We attribute the\nmechanism behind it to {\\bf Asymmetric Learning} in training attention\nnetworks. When the sign of the previous step is inconsistent with the sign of\nthe current step in the next-step-prediction time series, attention fails to\nlearn the residual features. This makes it difficult to generalize on\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, especially on the sign-inconsistent\nnext-step-prediction data, with the same representation pattern, whereas a\nlinear residual network could easily accomplish it.

Follow-up studies have largely involved altering the\ntokenization and self-attention modules to better adapt Transformers for\naddressing special challenges like non-stationarity, channel-wise dependency,\nand variable correlation in time series. However, we found that the expressive\ncapability of sequence representation is a key factor influencing Transformer\nperformance in time forecasting after investigating several representative\nmethods, where there is an almost linear relationship between sequence\nrepresentation entropy and mean square error, with more diverse representations\nperforming better. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism with\nSequence Complementors and prove feasible from an information theory\nperspective, where these learnable sequences are able to provide complementary\ninformation beyond current input to feed attention. We further enhance the\nSequence Complementors via a diversification loss that is theoretically\ncovered.

    "summary": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models\n(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the\ncomplexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required\nfor specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only\ntransformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object\nIdentification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like\nreasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two\nattention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and\nnormalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,\nand embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into\nadditive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.\nFurthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar\nperformance by composing information across layers through query-value\ninteractions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces\nhighly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for\nprobing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.",

    "title": "Rethinking Transformer for Long Contextual Histopathology Whole Slide\n  Image Analysis",
    "summary": "Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard\nfor clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop\ncomputer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ\nMulti-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level\nlabels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise\ninteractions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model\ncontextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized\nto address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long\nsequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL\nemploys approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from\nsuboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use\nof absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long\ncontextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze\nhow the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the\nrepresentation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of\nattention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local\nattention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the\nattention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the\nlocal attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation,\nreducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local\nbandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for\nboth computational acceleration and local-global information interactions\nmodelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through\nextensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our\ncode will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.",

    "title": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision\n  Transformers?",
    "summary": "Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation that consists\nof learnable activation functions, with the potential to capture more complex\nrelationships from data. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer\nperceptrons (MLPs) in deep networks, including advanced architectures such as\nvision Transformers (ViTs). This work asks whether KAN could learn token\ninteractions. In this paper, we design the first learnable attention called\nKolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for ViTs that can operate on any basis,\nranging from Fourier, Wavelets, Splines, to Rational Functions. However,\nlearnable activations in the attention cause a memory explosion. To remedy\nthis, we propose a modular version of KArAt that uses a low-rank approximation.\nBy adopting the Fourier basis, Fourier-KArAt and its variants, in some cases,\noutperform their traditional softmax counterparts, or show comparable\nperformance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. We also deploy Fourier\nKArAt to ConViT and Swin-Transformer, and use it in detection and segmentation\nwith ViT-Det. We dissect the performance of these architectures by analyzing\ntheir loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer paths, attention\nvisualizations, and transferability to other datasets. KArAt's learnable\nactivation yields a better attention score across all ViTs, indicating improved\ntoken-to-token interactions and contributing to enhanced inference. Still, its\ngeneralizability does not scale with larger ViTs. However, many factors,\nincluding the present computing interface, affect the relative performance of\nparameter- and memory-heavy KArAts. We note that the goal of this paper is not\nto produce efficient attention or challenge the traditional activations; by\ndesigning KArAt, we are the first to show that attention can be learned and\nencourage researchers to explore KArAt in conjunction with more advanced\narchitectures.",

First, we revisit Transformer\nmodel configurations specifically for language modeling.

We carry out experiments\non the open-source LibriSpeech 960hr task, for both 200K vocabulary word-level\nand 10K byte-pair encoding subword-level language modeling. We apply our\nword-level models to conventional hybrid speech recognition by lattice\nrescoring, and the subword-level models to attention based encoder-decoder\nmodels by shallow fusion. Second, we show that deep Transformer language models\ndo not require positional encoding. The positional encoding is an essential\naugmentation for the self-attention mechanism which is invariant to sequence\nordering. However, in autoregressive setup, as is the case for language\nmodeling, the amount of information increases along the position dimension,\nwhich is a positional signal by its own. The analysis of attention weights\nshows that deep autoregressive self-attention models can automatically make use\nof such positional information.

Attentions from multiple levels of the Transformer,\nwhich focus on different regions of interest, are further combined to generate\na global image representation. In addition, the output tokens from Transformer\nlayers filtered by the fused attention mask are considered as key-patch\ndescriptors, which are used to perform spatial matching to re-rank the\ncandidates retrieved by the global image features.

    "summary": "Transformer-based models have achieved top performance on major video\nrecognition benchmarks. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, these\nmodels show stronger ability of modeling long-range dependencies compared to\nCNN-based models. However, significant computation overheads, resulted from the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention on top of a tremendous number of tokens,\nlimit the use of existing video transformers in applications with limited\nresources like mobile devices. In this paper, we extend Mobile-Former to Video\nMobile-Former, which decouples the video architecture into a lightweight\n3D-CNNs for local context modeling and a Transformer modules for global\ninteraction modeling in a parallel fashion. To avoid significant computational\ncost incurred by computing self-attention between the large number of local\npatches in videos, we propose to use very few global tokens (e.g., 6) for a\nwhole video in Transformers to exchange information with 3D-CNNs with a\ncross-attention mechanism. Through efficient global spatial-temporal modeling,\nVideo Mobile-Former significantly improves the video recognition performance of\nalternative lightweight baselines, and outperforms other efficient CNN-based\nmodels at the low FLOP regime from 500M to 6G total FLOPs on various video\nrecognition tasks.

Language naturally contains highly semantic structures\nthat are directly interpretable by humans.

We employ two types\nof transformer layers: local layers operate on data tokens within each group,\nwhile global layers operate on a smaller set of introduced latent tokens. These\nlayers, comprising the same set of self-attention and feed-forward layers as\nstandard transformers, are interleaved, and cross-attention is used to\nfacilitate information exchange between data and latent tokens within the same\ngroup. The attention complexity is $O(n^2)$ locally within each group of size\n$n$, but can reach $O(L^{{4}/{3}})$ globally for sequence length of $L$. The\nefficiency can be further enhanced by relying more on global layers that\nperform adaptive computation using a smaller set of latent tokens. FIT is a\nversatile architecture and can function as an encoder, diffusion decoder, or\nautoregressive decoder. We provide initial evidence demonstrating its\neffectiveness in high-resolution image understanding and generation tasks.\nNotably, FIT exhibits potential in performing end-to-end training on\ngigabit-scale data, such as 6400$\\times$6400 images, or 160K tokens (after\npatch tokenization), within a memory capacity of 16GB, without requiring\nspecific optimizations or model parallelism.",

    "summary": "Transformers use the dense self-attention mechanism which gives a lot of\nflexibility for long-range connectivity. Over multiple layers of a deep\ntransformer, the number of possible connectivity patterns increases\nexponentially. However, very few of these contribute to the performance of the\nnetwork, and even fewer are essential. We hypothesize that there are sparsely\nconnected sub-networks within a transformer, called information pathways which\ncan be trained independently. However, the dynamic (i.e., input-dependent)\nnature of these pathways makes it difficult to prune dense self-attention\nduring training. But the overall distribution of these pathways is often\npredictable. We take advantage of this fact to propose Stochastically\nSubsampled self-Attention (SSA) - a general-purpose training strategy for\ntransformers that can reduce both the memory and computational cost of\nself-attention by 4 to 8 times during training while also serving as a\nregularization method - improving generalization over dense training. We show\nthat an ensemble of sub-models can be formed from the subsampled pathways\nwithin a network, which can achieve better performance than its densely\nattended counterpart. We perform experiments on a variety of NLP, computer\nvision and graph learning tasks in both generative and discriminative settings\nto provide empirical evidence for our claims and show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.",

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear\nattention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space\nmodels (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational\ninefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as\nattention on important modalities such as language.

First, simply letting the SSM parameters be\nfunctions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,\nallowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the\nsequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though\nthis change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a\nhardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these\nselective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without\nattention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

Despite their success, transformer-based models require\nsubstantial resources for training, including data, memory, and computational\npower, which may restrict their applicability for end users with limited\nresources. In particular, existing transformer-based 3D image registration\narchitectures face two critical gaps that challenge their efficiency and\neffectiveness.

    "summary": "Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable\nperformance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and\nbioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation\ntechniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to\nobtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD.\nHowever, most previous works only considered the relationship between\nnodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure\npatterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing\nmethods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not\nable to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a\nmethod with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship\nacross different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSimplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level\nAnomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we\nconstruct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship\nbetween nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives.\nFurthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the\nview co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node\nlevel and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\napply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural\nnetwork and transformer working collaboratively.

Dominant approaches in video\nsummarization primarily rely on recurrent or convolutional neural networks, and\nmore recently on encoder-only transformer architectures. However, these methods\ntypically suffer from several limitations in parallelism, modeling long-range\ndependencies, and providing explicit generative capabilities. To address these\nissues, we propose a transformer-like architecture named FullTransNet with\ntwo-fold ideas. First, it uses a full transformer with an encoder-decoder\nstructure as an alternative architecture for video summarization. As the full\ntransformer is specifically designed for sequence transduction tasks, its\ndirect application to video summarization is both intuitive and effective.\nSecond, it replaces the standard full attention mechanism with a combination of\nlocal and global sparse attention, enabling the model to capture long-range\ndependencies while significantly reducing computational costs. This\nlocal-global sparse attention is applied exclusively at the encoder side, where\nthe majority of computations occur, further enhancing efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, SumMe and TVSum, demonstrate\nthat our model achieves F-scores of 54.4% and 63.9%, respectively, while\nmaintaining relatively low computational and memory requirements.

Additionally, the\nsequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties\nfor real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers\nimpractical.

However, over-smoothing has always hindered\nGNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs,\nTransformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via\nmulti-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more\nimmunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, can we propose a novel framework to\ncombine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information\naggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate\nthe over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a\ncollaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC\narchitecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node\ninformation from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive\nlearning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize\nself-supervised heterogeneous graph representation.

    "summary": "Quantum Transformers integrate the representational power of classical\nTransformers with the computational advantages of quantum computing. Since\n2022, research in this area has rapidly expanded, giving rise to diverse\ntechnical paradigms and early applications. To address the growing need for\nconsolidation, this paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic, and\nin-depth survey of quantum Transformer models. First, we delineate the research\nscope, focusing on improving Transformer parts with quantum methods, and\nintroduce foundational concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine\nlearning. Then we organize existing studies into two main paradigms: PQC-based\nand QLA-based, with PQC-based paradigm further divided into QKV-only Quantum\nMapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Holistic Attention. and\nQuantum-Assisted Optimization, analyzing their core mechanisms and\narchitectural traits. We also summarize empirical results that demonstrate\npreliminary quantum advantages, especially on small-scale tasks or\nresource-constrained settings. Following this, we examine key technical\nchallenges, such as complexity-resource trade-offs, scalability and\ngeneralization limitations, and trainability issues including barren plateaus,\nand provide potential solutions, including quantumizing classical transformer\nvariants with lower complexity, hybrid designs, and improved optimization\nstrategies. Finally, we propose several promising future directions, e.g.,\nscaling quantum modules into large architectures, applying quantum Transformers\nto domains with inherently quantum data (e.g., physics, chemistry), and\ndeveloping theory-driven designs grounded in quantum information science. This\nsurvey will help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall\nlandscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future\ndevelopments in this emerging field.",

Given an image,\ntwo different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are constructed, where the\noutputs of two CNNs are correlated through bilinear pooling to simultaneously\nfocus on discriminative regions and extract relevant features. To capture\nspatial distributions among the local regions with visual attention, soft\nattention based spatial Long-Short Term Memory units (LSTMs) are incorporated\nto realize spatially recurrent yet visually selective over local input\npatterns. All the above intuitions equip our network with the following novel\nmodel: two-stream CNN layers, bilinear pooling layer, spatial recurrent layer\nwith location attention are jointly trained via an end-to-end fashion to serve\nas the part detector and feature extractor, whereby relevant features are\nlocalized and extracted attentively.

    "summary": "Attention is a powerful and ubiquitous mechanism for allowing neural models\nto focus on particular salient pieces of information by taking their weighted\naverage when making predictions. In particular, multi-headed attention is a\ndriving force behind many recent state-of-the-art NLP models such as\nTransformer-based MT models and BERT. These models apply multiple attention\nmechanisms in parallel, with each attention \"head\" potentially focusing on\ndifferent parts of the input, which makes it possible to express sophisticated\nfunctions beyond the simple weighted average. In this paper we make the\nsurprising observation that even if models have been trained using multiple\nheads, in practice, a large percentage of attention heads can be removed at\ntest time without significantly impacting performance. In fact, some layers can\neven be reduced to a single head. We further examine greedy algorithms for\npruning down models, and the potential speed, memory efficiency, and accuracy\nimprovements obtainable therefrom. Finally, we analyze the results with respect\nto which parts of the model are more reliant on having multiple heads, and\nprovide precursory evidence that training dynamics play a role in the gains\nprovided by multi-head attention.",

Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks,\nour model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test\nefficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much\nlonger video clips (over one minute long).

    "summary": "Image-text matching is an important multi-modal task with massive\napplications. It tries to match the image and the text with similar semantic\ninformation. Existing approaches do not explicitly transform the different\nmodalities into a common space. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism which is\nwidely used in image-text matching models does not have supervision. We propose\na novel attention scheme which projects the image and text embedding into a\ncommon space and optimises the attention weights directly towards the\nevaluation metrics. The proposed attention scheme can be considered as a kind\nof supervised attention and requiring no additional annotations. It is trained\nvia a novel Discrete-continuous action space policy gradient algorithm, which\nis more effective in modelling complex action space than previous continuous\naction space policy gradient.

    "summary": "Understanding linguistics and morphology of resource-scarce code-mixed texts\nremains a key challenge in text processing. Although word embedding comes in\nhandy to support downstream tasks for low-resource languages, there are plenty\nof scopes in improving the quality of language representation particularly for\ncode-mixed languages. In this paper, we propose HIT, a robust representation\nlearning method for code-mixed texts. HIT is a hierarchical transformer-based\nframework that captures the semantic relationship among words and\nhierarchically learns the sentence-level semantics using a fused attention\nmechanism. HIT incorporates two attention modules, a multi-headed\nself-attention and an outer product attention module, and computes their\nweighted sum to obtain the attention weights. Our evaluation of HIT on one\nEuropean (Spanish) and five Indic (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and\nMalayalam) languages across four NLP tasks on eleven datasets suggests\nsignificant performance improvement against various state-of-the-art systems.\nWe further show the adaptability of learned representation across tasks in a\ntransfer learning setup (with and without fine-tuning).",

Therefore, instead of directly\niterating over all the input tokens, ATP transforms inputs into an orthogonal\nspace and computes attention only on the top principal bases (keys). Owing to\nthe observed low-rank structure in input sequences, ATP is able to capture\nsemantic relationships in input sequences with a few principal keys.\nFurthermore, the attention complexity is reduced from \\emph{quadratic} to\n\\emph{linear} without incurring a noticeable performance drop. ATP further\nreduces complexity for other linear layers with low-rank inputs, leading to\nmore speedup compared to prior works that solely target the attention module.\nOur evaluations on various models (e.g., BERT and Llama) demonstrate that ATP\nachieves comparable accuracy with much lower computation and memory complexity\nthan the standard attention mechanism.

    "summary": "Attention mechanism is a fundamental component of the transformer model and\nplays a significant role in its success. However, the theoretical understanding\nof how attention learns to select tokens is still an emerging area of research.\nIn this work, we study the training dynamics and generalization ability of the\nattention mechanism under classification problems with label noise. We show\nthat, with the characterization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the token\nselection of attention mechanism achieves benign overfitting, i.e., maintaining\nhigh generalization performance despite fitting label noise. Our work also\ndemonstrates an interesting delayed acquisition of generalization after an\ninitial phase of overfitting.

    "summary": "Most pronouns are referring expressions, computers need to resolve what do\nthe pronouns refer to, and there are divergences on pronoun usage across\nlanguages. Thus, dealing with these divergences and translating pronouns is a\nchallenge in machine translation. Mentions are referring candidates of pronouns\nand have closer relations with pronouns compared to general tokens. We assume\nthat extracting additional mention features can help pronoun translation.\nTherefore, we introduce an additional mention attention module in the decoder\nto pay extra attention to source mentions but not non-mention tokens. Our\nmention attention module not only extracts features from source mentions, but\nalso considers target-side context which benefits pronoun translation. In\naddition, we also introduce two mention classifiers to train models to\nrecognize mentions, whose outputs guide the mention attention. We conduct\nexperiments on the WMT17 English-German translation task, and evaluate our\nmodels on general translation and pronoun translation, using BLEU, APT, and\ncontrastive evaluation metrics. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline\nTransformer model in terms of APT and BLEU scores, this confirms our hypothesis\nthat we can improve pronoun translation by paying additional attention to\nsource mentions, and shows that our introduced additional modules do not have\nnegative effect on the general translation quality.",

The key idea of EFA is to model each observation\nconditional on all other existing observations, called the context, whose\nrelevance is learned in a data-driven way via an attention-based latent factor\nmodel. In particular, unlike static latent embeddings, EFA uses the\nself-attention mechanism to capture dynamic interactions in the context, where\nthe relevance of each context observations depends on other observations.

    "title": "Attention (as Discrete-Time Markov) Chains",
    "summary": "We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time\nMarkov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving\nattention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified\nframework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,\npropagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only\nmodel immediate effects. Our key observation is that tokens linked to\nsemantically similar regions form metastable states, i.e., regions where\nattention tends to concentrate, while noisy attention scores dissipate.\nMetastable states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple\nmatrix multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight\ntools, we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we\ndefine TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures\nglobal token importance. We show that TokenRank enhances unconditional image\ngeneration, improving both quality (IS) and diversity (FID), and can also be\nincorporated into existing segmentation techniques to improve their performance\nover existing benchmarks. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of how\ntokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.",

In this paper, we investigate two key\naspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally\ndesigned for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning\nstrategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that\nscanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield\npromising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of\nattention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is\nefficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid\narchitecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional\nAttention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its\neffectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses\nglobal information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict\nlocal modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising\nand practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.",

    "summary": "Following the success of the transformer architecture in the natural language\ndomain, transformer-like architectures have been widely applied to the domain\nof symbolic music recently. Symbolic music and text, however, are two different\nmodalities. Symbolic music contains multiple attributes, both absolute\nattributes (e.g., pitch) and relative attributes (e.g., pitch interval). These\nrelative attributes shape human perception of musical motifs. These important\nrelative attributes, however, are mostly ignored in existing symbolic music\nmodeling methods with the main reason being the lack of a musically-meaningful\nembedding space where both the absolute and relative embeddings of the symbolic\nmusic tokens can be efficiently represented. In this paper, we propose the\nFundamental Music Embedding (FME) for symbolic music based on a bias-adjusted\nsinusoidal encoding within which both the absolute and the relative attributes\ncan be embedded and the fundamental musical properties (e.g., translational\ninvariance) are explicitly preserved. Taking advantage of the proposed FME, we\nfurther propose a novel attention mechanism based on the relative index, pitch\nand onset embeddings (RIPO attention) such that the musical domain knowledge\ncan be fully utilized for symbolic music modeling. Experiment results show that\nour proposed model: RIPO transformer which utilizes FME and RIPO attention\noutperforms the state-of-the-art transformers (i.e., music transformer, linear\ntransformer) in a melody completion task. Moreover, using the RIPO transformer\nin a downstream music generation task, we notice that the notorious\ndegeneration phenomenon no longer exists and the music generated by the RIPO\ntransformer outperforms the music generated by state-of-the-art transformer\nmodels in both subjective and objective evaluations.",

In response, the algorithm community\nis exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs),\nlinear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as\npost-transformers.

To address this challenge, we analyze the\nperformance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite\ntheir algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory\nbandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state\nupdates in post-transformers.

    "title": "FuseMax: Leveraging Extended Einsums to Optimize Attention Accelerator\n  Design",
    "summary": "Attention for transformers is a critical workload that has recently received\nsignificant \"attention\" as a target for custom acceleration. Yet, while prior\nwork succeeds in reducing attention's memory-bandwidth requirements, it creates\nload imbalance between operators that comprise the attention computation\n(resulting in severe compute under-utilization) and requires on-chip memory\nthat scales with sequence length (which is expected to grow over time).\n  This paper ameliorates these issues, enabling attention with nearly 100%\ncompute utilization, no off-chip memory traffic bottlenecks, and on-chip buffer\nsize requirements that are independent of sequence length. The main conceptual\ncontribution is to use a recently proposed abstraction -- the cascade of\nEinsums -- to describe, formalize, and taxonomize the space of attention\nalgorithms that appear in the literature. In particular, we show how Einsum\ncascades can be used to infer non-trivial lower bounds on the number of passes\na kernel must take through its input data, which has implications for either\nrequired on-chip buffer capacity or memory traffic. We show how this notion can\nbe used to meaningfully divide the space of attention algorithms into several\ncategories and use these categories to inform our design process.\n  Based on the above characterization, we propose FuseMax -- a novel mapping\nand binding of attention onto a spatial array-style architecture. On attention,\nin an iso-area comparison, FuseMax achieves an average 6.7x speedup over the\nprior state-of-the-art, FLAT, while using 79\\% of the energy. Similarly, on\nfull end-to-end transformer inference, FuseMax achieves an average 5.3x speedup\nover FLAT using 83 of the energy.",

How competent are Transformers for various 3D\nprocessing tasks? As of now, there is still no systematic survey of the\nresearch on these issues. For the first time, we provided a comprehensive\noverview of increasingly popular Transformers for 3D point cloud analysis. We\nstart by introducing the theory of the Transformer architecture and reviewing\nits applications in 2D/3D fields.

    "summary": "Real-time personalization has advanced significantly in recent years, with\nplatforms utilizing machine learning models to predict user preferences based\non rich behavioral data on each individual user. Traditional approaches usually\nrely on embedding-based machine learning models to capture user preferences,\nand then reduce the final optimization task to nearest-neighbors, which can be\nperformed extremely fast. However, these models struggle to capture complex\nuser behaviors, which are essential for making accurate recommendations.\nTransformer-based models, on the other hand, are known for their practical\nability to model sequential behaviors, and hence have been intensively used in\npersonalization recently to overcome these limitations. However, optimizing\nrecommendations under transformer-based models is challenging due to their\ncomplicated architectures. In this paper, we address this challenge by\nconsidering a specific class of transformers, showing its ability to represent\ncomplex user preferences, and developing efficient algorithms for real-time\npersonalization.\n  We focus on a particular set of transformers, called simple transformers,\nwhich contain a single self-attention layer. We show that simple transformers\nare capable of capturing complex user preferences. We then develop an algorithm\nthat enables fast optimization of recommendation tasks based on simple\ntransformers. Our algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in sub-linear\ntime. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an\nempirical study on datasets from Spotify and Trivago. Our experiment results\nshow that (1) simple transformers can model/predict user preferences\nsubstantially more accurately than non-transformer models and nearly as\naccurately as more complex transformers, and (2) our algorithm completes\nsimple-transformer-based recommendation tasks quickly and effectively.",

In particular, a multilevel transformer based teacher-student model is\ndesigned, and knowledge distillation is performed across attention and hidden\nsub-layers of different transformer layers of the student and teacher models.\nWe achieve an intent classification accuracy of 99.10% and 88.79% for Fluent\nspeech corpus and ATIS database, respectively. Further, the proposed method\ndemonstrates better performance and robustness in acoustically degraded\ncondition compared to the baseline method.",

    "summary": "Recently, transformer architecture has demonstrated its significance in both\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks. Though other\nnetwork models are known to be vulnerable to the backdoor attack, which embeds\ntriggers in the model and controls the model behavior when the triggers are\npresented, little is known whether such an attack is still valid on the\ntransformer models and if so, whether it can be done in a more cost-efficient\nmanner. In this paper, we propose DBIA, a novel data-free backdoor attack\nagainst the CV-oriented transformer networks, leveraging the inherent attention\nmechanism of transformers to generate triggers and injecting the backdoor using\nthe poisoned surrogate dataset. We conducted extensive experiments based on\nthree benchmark transformers, i.e., ViT, DeiT and Swin Transformer, on two\nmainstream image classification tasks, i.e., CIFAR10 and ImageNet. The\nevaluation results demonstrate that, consuming fewer resources, our approach\ncan embed backdoors with a high success rate and a low impact on the\nperformance of the victim transformers.

Since its revival in the middle of the 1960s by David Hestenes, it\nattracts great attention and has been exploited in many fields such as physics,\ncomputer science, and engineering. This work introduces a geometric algebra\nmethod for the molecular surface generation that utilizes the Clifford-Fourier\ntransform which is a generalization of the classical Fourier transform.\nNotably, the classical Fourier transform and Clifford-Fourier transform differ\nin the derivative property in $R_k$ for k even. This distinction is due to the\nnoncommutativity of geometric product of pseudoscalars with multivectors and\nhas significant consequences in applications. We use the Clifford-Fourier\ntransform in $R_3$ to benefit from the derivative property in solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). The Clifford-Fourier transform is used to solve\nthe mode decomposition process in PDE transform. Two different initial cases\nare proposed to make the initial shapes used in the present method. The\nproposed method is applied first to small molecules and proteins. To validate\nthe method, the molecular surfaces generated are compared to surfaces of other\ndefinitions. Applications are considered to protein electrostatic analysis.\nThis work opens the door for further applications of geometric algebra and\nClifford-Fourier transform in biological sciences.",

The same is also proven for transformers with\npositional encodings (like RoPE and ALiBi).

Compared\nto GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage\ndynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,\nthereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.\nHowever, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no\nlonger crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in\nsome fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first\nexplore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,\nspecifically in terms of relative positions.

Motivated by\nthe fact that dense synthesizer attention (DSA), which dispenses with dot\nproducts and pairwise interactions, achieved competitive results in many\nlanguage processing tasks, in this paper, we first propose a DSA-based speech\nrecognition, as an alternative to SA. To reduce the computational complexity\nand improve the performance, we further propose local DSA (LDSA) to restrict\nthe attention scope of DSA to a local range around the current central frame\nfor speech recognition. Finally, we combine LDSA with SA to extract the local\nand global information simultaneously. Experimental results on the Ai-shell1\nMandarine speech recognition corpus show that the proposed LDSA-Transformer\nachieves a character error rate (CER) of 6.49%, which is slightly better than\nthat of the SA-Transformer. Meanwhile, the LDSA-Transformer requires less\ncomputation than the SATransformer.

    "summary": "The synergy of long-range dependencies from transformers and local\nrepresentations of image content from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has\nled to advanced architectures and increased performance for various medical\nimage analysis tasks due to their complementary benefits. However, compared\nwith CNNs, transformers require considerably more training data, due to a\nlarger number of parameters and an absence of inductive bias. The need for\nincreasingly large datasets continues to be problematic, particularly in the\ncontext of medical imaging, where both annotation efforts and data protection\nresult in limited data availability. In this work, inspired by the human\ndecision-making process of correlating new evidence with previously memorized\nexperience, we propose a Memorizing Vision Transformer (MoViT) to alleviate the\nneed for large-scale datasets to successfully train and deploy\ntransformer-based architectures. MoViT leverages an external memory structure\nto cache history attention snapshots during the training stage. To prevent\noverfitting, we incorporate an innovative memory update scheme, attention\ntemporal moving average, to update the stored external memories with the\nhistorical moving average. For inference speedup, we design a prototypical\nattention learning method to distill the external memory into smaller\nrepresentative subsets. We evaluate our method on a public histology image\ndataset and an in-house MRI dataset, demonstrating that MoViT applied to varied\nmedical image analysis tasks, can outperform vanilla transformer models across\nvaried data regimes, especially in cases where only a small amount of annotated\ndata is available.

Owing to these properties, the Swin Transformer is suitable for\nestablishing more distant relationships between corresponding voxels in\ndifferent positions in complex abdominal image registration tasks. However, the\nregistration models based on transformers combine multiple voxels into a single\nsemantic token. This merging process limits the transformers to model and\ngenerate coarse-grained spatial information. To address this issue, we propose\nRecovery Feature Resolution Network (RFRNet), which allows the transformer to\ncontribute fine-grained spatial information and rich semantic correspondences\nto higher resolution levels. Furthermore, shifted window partitioning\noperations are inflexible, indicating that they cannot perceive the semantic\ninformation over uncertain distances and automatically bridge the global\nconnections between windows. Therefore, we present a Weighted Window Attention\n(WWA) to build global interactions between windows automatically.

    "summary": "In recent years, point cloud analysis methods based on the Transformer\narchitecture have made significant progress, particularly in the context of\nmultimedia applications such as 3D modeling, virtual reality, and autonomous\nsystems. However, the high computational resource demands of the Transformer\narchitecture hinder its scalability, real-time processing capabilities, and\ndeployment on mobile devices and other platforms with limited computational\nresources. This limitation remains a significant obstacle to its practical\napplication in scenarios requiring on-device intelligence and multimedia\nprocessing. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient point cloud\nanalysis architecture, \\textbf{Point} \\textbf{M}LP-\\textbf{T}ransformer\n(PointMT). This study tackles the quadratic complexity of the self-attention\nmechanism by introducing a linear complexity local attention mechanism for\neffective feature aggregation. Additionally, to counter the Transformer's focus\non token differences while neglecting channel differences, we introduce a\nparameter-free channel temperature adaptation mechanism that adaptively adjusts\nthe attention weight distribution in each channel, enhancing the precision of\nfeature aggregation. To improve the Transformer's slow convergence speed due to\nthe limited scale of point cloud datasets, we propose an MLP-Transformer hybrid\nmodule, which significantly enhances the model's convergence speed.\nFurthermore, to boost the feature representation capability of point tokens, we\nrefine the classification head, enabling point tokens to directly participate\nin prediction.

We posit there to be\ndownside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of\nthis idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and\nmore accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace\nself-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal\nlanguage modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and\neven outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small\n($n_{ctx}<512$) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the\nhypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training\nefficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation\naccuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the\ninformation loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to\nretrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a\nbijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more\neffective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is\nunchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine\nsimilarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization.

By learning long-term dependencies,\nTransformer can effectively integrate multimodal features in the feature\nextraction stage, which greatly improves the performance of multimodal object\ndetection. However, current methods merely stack Transformer-guided fusion\ntechniques without exploring their capability to extract features at various\ndepth layers of network, thus limiting the improvements in detection\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce an accurate and efficient object\ndetection method named SeaDATE. Initially, we propose a novel dual attention\nFeature Fusion (DTF) module that, under Transformer's guidance, integrates\nlocal and global information through a dual attention mechanism, strengthening\nthe fusion of modal features from orthogonal perspectives using spatial and\nchannel tokens. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation\ndemonstrate that the Transformer-guided fusion method, treating images as\nsequences of pixels for fusion, performs better on shallow features' detail\ninformation compared to deep semantic information.

MoD employs a router to select\nthe most important ones for processing within a transformer layer.

In our work, we analyze the unified transformers by (1)\nexamining attention weight patterns, (2) evaluating the layer importance and\ntoken redundancy, and (3) analyzing task interactions. Our findings reveal that\ntoken redundancy is primarily influenced by different tasks and layers.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce UniMoD, a task-aware token pruning\nmethod that employs a separate router for each task to determine which tokens\nshould be pruned.

    "summary": "The self-attention mechanism has attracted wide publicity for its most\nimportant advantage of modeling long dependency, and its variations in computer\nvision tasks, the non-local block tries to model the global dependency of the\ninput feature maps. Gathering global contextual information will inevitably\nneed a tremendous amount of memory and computing resources, which has been\nextensively studied in the past several years. However, there is a further\nproblem with the self-attention scheme: is all information gathered from the\nglobal scope helpful for the contextual modelling? To our knowledge, few\nstudies have focused on the problem. Aimed at both questions this paper\nproposes the salient positions-based attention scheme SPANet, which is inspired\nby some interesting observations on the attention maps and affinity matrices\ngenerated in self-attention scheme. We believe these observations are\nbeneficial for better understanding of the self-attention. SPANet uses the\nsalient positions selection algorithm to select only a limited amount of\nsalient points to attend in the attention map computing. This approach will not\nonly spare a lot of memory and computing resources, but also try to distill the\npositive information from the transformation of the input feature maps. In the\nimplementation, considering the feature maps with channel high dimensions,\nwhich are completely different from the general visual image, we take the\nsquared power of the feature maps along the channel dimension as the saliency\nmetric of the positions.

    "summary": "Attention module does not always help deep models learn causal features that\nare robust in any confounding context, e.g., a foreground object feature is\ninvariant to different backgrounds. This is because the confounders trick the\nattention to capture spurious correlations that benefit the prediction when the\ntraining and testing data are IID (identical & independent distribution); while\nharm the prediction when the data are OOD (out-of-distribution). The sole\nfundamental solution to learn causal attention is by causal intervention, which\nrequires additional annotations of the confounders, e.g., a \"dog\" model is\nlearned within \"grass+dog\" and \"road+dog\" respectively, so the \"grass\" and\n\"road\" contexts will no longer confound the \"dog\" recognition. However, such\nannotation is not only prohibitively expensive, but also inherently\nproblematic, as the confounders are elusive in nature. In this paper, we\npropose a causal attention module (CaaM) that self-annotates the confounders in\nunsupervised fashion. In particular, multiple CaaMs can be stacked and\nintegrated in conventional attention CNN and self-attention Vision Transformer.\nIn OOD settings, deep models with CaaM outperform those without it\nsignificantly; even in IID settings, the attention localization is also\nimproved by CaaM, showing a great potential in applications that require robust\nvisual saliency.

Additionally, existing\nresearch that combines convolution with self-attention relies on global\nattention, which is not practical for processing large point clouds. To address\nthese challenges, this study proposes a new architecture, pCTFusion, which\ncombines kernel-based convolutions and self-attention mechanisms for better\nfeature learning and capturing local and global dependencies in segmentation.\nThe proposed architecture employs two types of self-attention mechanisms, local\nand global, based on the hierarchical positions of the encoder blocks.\nFurthermore, the existing loss functions do not consider the semantic and\nposition-wise importance of the points, resulting in reduced accuracy,\nparticularly at sharp class boundaries. To overcome this, the study models a\nnovel attention-based loss function called Pointwise Geometric Anisotropy\n(PGA), which assigns weights based on the semantic distribution of points in a\nneighborhood. The proposed architecture is evaluated on SemanticKITTI outdoor\ndataset and showed a 5-7% improvement in performance compared to the\nstate-of-the-art architectures.

The\nbest-performing HuMAL strategy significantly enhances the task performance of\nfine-tuned transformer models (BERT, as well as GPT-2 and XLNET), and the\nbenefit is particularly pronounced under challenging conditions of imbalanced\nor sparse labeled data. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of\nstrategies for integrating human attention into ML models and highlights the\npotential of leveraging human cognition to augment ML in real-world\napplications.",

    "title": "PAPN: Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer Network Decoder for Parcel\n  Pickup Route Prediction",
    "summary": "Optimization of the last-mile delivery and first-mile pickup of parcels is an\nintegral part of the broader logistics optimization pipeline as it entails both\ncost and resource efficiency as well as a heightened service quality. Such\noptimization requires accurate route and time prediction systems to adapt to\ndifferent scenarios in advance. This work tackles the first building block,\nnamely route prediction. This is done by introducing a novel Proximity\nAttention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer\nNetwork in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer\nNetwork decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the\ndifferent visitable pickup positions at each timestep. To this local attention\nprocess is coupled global context computing via a multi-head attention\ntransformer encoder. The obtained global context is then mixed to an aggregated\nversion of the local embedding thus achieving a mix of global and local\nattention for complete modeling of the problems. Proximity attention is also\nused in the decoding process to skew predictions towards the locations with the\nhighest attention scores and thus using inter-connectivity of locations as a\nbase for next-location prediction. This method is trained, validated and tested\non a large industry-level dataset of real-world, large-scale last-mile delivery\nand first-mile pickup named LaDE[1]. This approach shows noticeable promise,\noutperforming all state-of-the-art supervised systems in terms of most metrics\nused for benchmarking methods on this dataset while still being competitive\nwith the best-performing reinforcement learning method named DRL4Route[2].",

    "title": "RATTENTION: Towards the Minimal Sliding Window Size in Local-Global\n  Attention Models",
    "summary": "Local-global attention models have recently emerged as compelling\nalternatives to standard Transformers, promising improvements in both training\nand inference efficiency. However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of\njust 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across\ndiverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear\nattention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context\nperformance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements\ndo not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel\nimplementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training\nspeeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "summary": "Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit\nmajor computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration\nvideos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high\ntraining and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key\nchallenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and\nKey-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to\nleverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nBidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,\nthe first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D\nfull attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference\nefficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query\nsparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via\nsemantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV\nsparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain\nonly the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long\nsequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention\ntraining, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full\nattention.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually\ncompelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,\nentertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion\ntransformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs\n(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention\nmechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational\nbottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)\nimpractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we\npresent UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient\nand ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis.

    "summary": "Transformer has achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art\nend-to-end models in automatic speech recognition (ASR), and requires\nsignificantly less training time than RNN-based models. The original\nTransformer, with encoder-decoder architecture, is only suitable for offline\nASR. It relies on an attention mechanism to learn alignments, and encodes input\naudio bidirectionally. The high computation cost of Transformer decoding also\nlimits its use in production streaming systems. To make Transformer suitable\nfor streaming ASR, we explore Transducer framework as a streamable way to learn\nalignments. For audio encoding, we apply unidirectional Transformer with\ninterleaved convolution layers. The interleaved convolution layers are used for\nmodeling future context which is important to performance. To reduce\ncomputation cost, we gradually downsample acoustic input, also with the\ninterleaved convolution layers. Moreover, we limit the length of history\ncontext in self-attention to maintain constant computation cost for each\ndecoding step. We show that this architecture, named Conv-Transformer\nTransducer, achieves competitive performance on LibriSpeech dataset (3.6\\% WER\non test-clean) without external language models. The performance is comparable\nto previously published streamable Transformer Transducer and strong hybrid\nstreaming ASR systems, and is achieved with smaller look-ahead window (140~ms),\nfewer parameters and lower frame rate.",

    "summary": "Despite their ubiquity in core AI fields like natural language processing,\nthe mechanics of deep attention-based neural networks like the Transformer\nmodel are not fully understood. In this article, we present a new perspective\ntowards understanding how Transformers work. In particular, we show that the\n\"dot-product attention\" that is the core of the Transformer's operation can be\ncharacterized as a kernel learning method on a pair of Banach spaces. In\nparticular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite\nfeature dimension. Along the way we consider an extension of the standard\nkernel learning problem to a binary setting, where data come from two input\ndomains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new\nrepresenter theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer\n(indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are\nelements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and\nalso prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer\ncalculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space\npair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that\nsuggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is\npartially responsible for its performance. This paper's results provide a new\ntheoretical understanding of a very important but poorly understood model in\nmodern machine~learning.",

Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches\nprimarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the\nintra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have\nsuccessfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image\nclassification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal\nlearning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract\nfine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and\nenhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer\nwith pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer\ndesign in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical\nspatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our\nshifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame\nvariances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model\nlong-term temporal dependencies.

In the 3D setting, convolution on volumetric\ndata and transformers both consume large GPU memory.

    "summary": "Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved promising performance in\nimage recognition and gradually serves as a powerful backbone in various vision\ntasks. To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first\nsplits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then\nthe following self-attention layers constructs the global relationship between\ntokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically,\nrepresenting the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the\nquadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of\ntokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT's inference. For\ncomputational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune\nuninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of\ntokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for\nthe Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost.\nIn this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the\npaper. MT-ViT adopts multiple tails to produce visual sequences of different\nlengths for the following Transformer encoder. A tail predictor is introduced\nto decide which tail is the most efficient for the image to produce accurate\nprediction. Both modules are optimized in an end-to-end fashion, with the\nGumbel-Softmax trick.

Despite their efficacy, accelerating\nthe transformer is challenging due to its quadratic computational complexity\nand large activation sizes. Existing transformer accelerators attempt to prune\nits tokens to reduce memory access, albeit with high compute overheads.\nMoreover, previous works directly operate on large matrices involved in the\nattention operation, which limits hardware utilization. In order to address\nthese challenges, this work proposes a novel dynamic inference scheme,\nDynaTran, which prunes activations at runtime with low overhead, substantially\nreducing the number of ineffectual operations. This improves the throughput of\ntransformer inference. We further propose tiling the matrices in transformer\noperations along with diverse dataflows to improve data reuse, thus enabling\nhigher energy efficiency.

Recent works on self-supervised learning (SSL) introduce\nsiamese pre-training tasks, on which Transformer backbones continue to\ndemonstrate ever stronger results than CNNs.

However, it is noteworthy that most if not all prior\narts of SSL with CNNs chose the standard ResNets as their backbones, whose\narchitecture effectiveness is known to already lag behind advanced Vision\nTransformers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the self-attention\noperation is crucial for the recent advances in SSL - or CNNs can deliver the\nsame excellence with more advanced designs, too?

To answer these intriguing\nquestions, we apply self-supervised pre-training to the recently proposed,\nstronger lager-kernel CNN architecture and conduct an apple-to-apple comparison\nwith Transformers, in their SSL performance.

Critical to this\nsuccess are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens\nbased on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel\nframework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal\nstructures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of\ninduction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and\nlearn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal\nstructure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the\nrelationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our\nframework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with\ndifferent lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting\nunveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows\ntransformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure\nin-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism\nto predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the\ncorresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a\n3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a\ntheoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to\nthe maximum likelihood solution.

Embedding the position information in the self-attention\nmechanism is also an indispensable factor in Transformers however is often\ndiscussed at will. Therefore, this paper carries out an empirical study on\nposition embeddings of mainstream pre-trained Transformers, which mainly\nfocuses on two questions: 1) Do position embeddings really learn the meaning of\npositions? 2) How do these different learned position embeddings affect\nTransformers for NLP tasks? This paper focuses on providing a new insight of\npre-trained position embeddings through feature-level analysis and empirical\nexperiments on most of iconic NLP tasks. It is believed that our experimental\nresults can guide the future work to choose the suitable positional encoding\nfunction for specific tasks given the application property.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based methods have shown great potential in long-term time series\nforecasting. However, most of these methods adopt the standard point-wise\nself-attention mechanism, which not only becomes intractable for long-term\nforecasting since its complexity increases quadratically with the length of\ntime series, but also cannot explicitly capture the predictive dependencies\nfrom contexts since the corresponding key and value are transformed from the\nsame point. This paper proposes a predictive Transformer-based model called\n{\\em Preformer}. Preformer introduces a novel efficient {\\em Multi-Scale\nSegment-Correlation} mechanism that divides time series into segments and\nutilizes segment-wise correlation-based attention for encoding time series. A\nmulti-scale structure is developed to aggregate dependencies at different\ntemporal scales and facilitate the selection of segment length. Preformer\nfurther designs a predictive paradigm for decoding, where the key and value\ncome from two successive segments rather than the same segment. In this way, if\na key segment has a high correlation score with the query segment, its\nsuccessive segment contributes more to the prediction of the query segment.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our Preformer outperforms other\nTransformer-based methods.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a pure transformer-based approach, dubbed the Multi-Modal\nVideo Transformer (MM-ViT), for video action recognition. Different from other\nschemes which solely utilize the decoded RGB frames, MM-ViT operates\nexclusively in the compressed video domain and exploits all readily available\nmodalities, i.e., I-frames, motion vectors, residuals and audio waveform. In\norder to handle the large number of spatiotemporal tokens extracted from\nmultiple modalities, we develop several scalable model variants which factorize\nself-attention across the space, time and modality dimensions. In addition, to\nfurther explore the rich inter-modal interactions and their effects, we develop\nand compare three distinct cross-modal attention mechanisms that can be\nseamlessly integrated into the transformer building block. Extensive\nexperiments on three public action recognition benchmarks (UCF-101,\nSomething-Something-v2, Kinetics-600) demonstrate that MM-ViT outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art video transformers in both efficiency and accuracy, and\nperforms better or equally well to the state-of-the-art CNN counterparts with\ncomputationally-heavy optical flow.",

    "summary": "Recent object tracking methods depend upon deep networks or convoluted\narchitectures. Most of those trackers can hardly meet real-time processing\nrequirements on mobile platforms with limited computing resources. In this\nwork, we introduce the Siamese Transformer Pyramid Network (SiamTPN), which\ninherits the advantages from both CNN and Transformer architectures.\nSpecifically, we exploit the inherent feature pyramid of a lightweight network\n(ShuffleNetV2) and reinforce it with a Transformer to construct a robust\ntarget-specific appearance model. A centralized architecture with lateral cross\nattention is developed for building augmented high-level feature maps. To avoid\nthe computation and memory intensity while fusing pyramid representations with\nthe Transformer, we further introduce the pooling attention module, which\nsignificantly reduces memory and time complexity while improving the\nrobustness. Comprehensive experiments on both aerial and prevalent tracking\nbenchmarks achieve competitive results while operating at high speed,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of SiamTPN. Moreover, our fastest variant\ntracker operates over 30 Hz on a single CPU-core and obtaining an AUC score of\n58.1% on the LaSOT dataset.

    "summary": "Most existing transformer based video instance segmentation methods extract\nper frame features independently, hence it is challenging to solve the\nappearance deformation problem. In this paper, we observe the temporal\ninformation is important as well and we propose TAFormer to aggregate\nspatio-temporal features both in transformer encoder and decoder. Specifically,\nin transformer encoder, we propose a novel spatio-temporal joint multi-scale\ndeformable attention module which dynamically integrates the spatial and\ntemporal information to obtain enriched spatio-temporal features. In\ntransformer decoder, we introduce a temporal self-attention module to enhance\nthe frame level box queries with the temporal relation. Moreover, TAFormer\nadopts an instance level contrastive loss to increase the discriminability of\ninstance query embeddings. Therefore the tracking error caused by visually\nsimilar instances can be decreased. Experimental results show that TAFormer\neffectively leverages the spatial and temporal information to obtain\ncontext-aware feature representation and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Unlike previous multi-modal transformers that directly\nconnecting all patches from two modalities, we explore the cross-modal\ncomplementarity hierarchically to respect the modality gap and spatial\ndiscrepancy in unaligned regions. Specifically, we propose to use intra-modal\nself-attention to explore complementary global contexts, and measure\nspatial-aligned inter-modal attention locally to capture cross-modal\ncorrelations. In addition, we present a Feature Pyramid module for Transformer\n(FPT) to boost informative cross-scale integration as well as a\nconsistency-complementarity module to disentangle the multi-modal integration\npath and improve the fusion adaptivity.

In this\npaper, we propose TransCAR, a Transformer-based Camera-And-Radar fusion\nsolution for 3D object detection. Our TransCAR consists of two modules. The\nfirst module learns 2D features from surround-view camera images and then uses\na sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features. The\nvision-updated queries then interact with each other via transformer\nself-attention layer. The second module learns radar features from multiple\nradar scans and then applies transformer decoder to learn the interactions\nbetween radar features and vision-updated queries. The cross-attention layer\nwithin the transformer decoder can adaptively learn the soft-association\nbetween the radar features and vision-updated queries instead of\nhard-association based on sensor calibration only. Finally, our model estimates\na bounding box per query using set-to-set Hungarian loss, which enables the\nmethod to avoid non-maximum suppression.

Drawing\ninspiration from Masked Modeling techniquesutilized in image processing with\nMasked Autoencoders (MAE) \\cite{he2022masked} and in natural language\nprocessing with Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\n\\cite{radford2018improving}, we treat behavior sequences as a blend of images\nand language.

This correlation is particularly valuable, as it reflects the\ncoordinated movement of various parts of the fish body across adjacent frames.\nTo handle the high frame rate, we segment the skeleton sequence into distinct\ntime slices, analogous to \"words\" in a sentence, and employ self-attention\ntransformer layers to encode the consecutive frames within each slice,\ncapturing the spatial correlation among different joints. Furthermore, we\nincorporate a CNN-based attention module to enhance the representations\noutputted by the transformer layers.

The methods include ConvNet-based and Transformer-based methods.\nAlthough ConvNets can effectively utilize local information to reduce\nredundancy via small neighborhood convolution, the limited receptive field\nresults in the inability to capture global dependencies. Transformers can\nestablish long-distance dependencies via a self-attention mechanism; however,\nthe intense calculation of the relationships among all tokens leads to high\nredundancy. We propose a novel unsupervised image registration method named the\nunified Transformer and superresolution (UTSRMorph) network, which can enhance\nfeature representation learning in the encoder and generate detailed\ndisplacement fields in the decoder to overcome these problems. We first propose\na fusion attention block to integrate the advantages of ConvNets and\nTransformers, which inserts a ConvNet-based channel attention module into a\nmultihead self-attention module. The overlapping attention block, a novel\ncross-attention method, uses overlapping windows to obtain abundant\ncorrelations with match information of a pair of images. Then, the blocks are\nflexibly stacked into a new powerful encoder.

    "summary": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive alternative to\nconvolutional neural networks for various computer vision applications.\nSpecifically, ViT multi-head attention layers make it possible to embed\ninformation globally across the overall image. Nevertheless, computing and\nstoring such attention matrices incurs a quadratic cost dependency on the\nnumber of patches, limiting its achievable efficiency and scalability and\nprohibiting more extensive real-world ViT applications on resource-constrained\ndevices. Sparse attention has been shown to be a promising direction for\nimproving hardware acceleration efficiency for NLP models. However, a\nsystematic counterpart approach is still missing for accelerating ViT models.\nTo close the above gap, we propose a first-of-its-kind algorithm-hardware\ncodesigned framework, dubbed ViTALiTy, for boosting the inference efficiency of\nViTs. Unlike sparsity-based Transformer accelerators for NLP, ViTALiTy unifies\nboth low-rank and sparse components of the attention in ViTs. At the algorithm\nlevel, we approximate the dot-product softmax operation via first-order Taylor\nattention with row-mean centering as the low-rank component to linearize the\ncost of attention blocks and further boost the accuracy by incorporating a\nsparsity-based regularization. At the hardware level, we develop a dedicated\naccelerator to better leverage the resulting workload and pipeline from\nViTALiTy's linear Taylor attention which requires the execution of only the\nlow-rank component, to further boost the hardware efficiency. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies validate that ViTALiTy offers boosted\nend-to-end efficiency (e.g., $3\\times$ faster and $3\\times$ energy-efficient)\nunder comparable accuracy, with respect to the state-of-the-art solution.",

Second, learning an explicit\nassociation between labels and language constructs. We propose label-attention\nTransformer with geometrically coherent objects (LATGeO). The proposed\ntechnique acquires a proposal of geometrically coherent objects using a deep\nneural network (DNN) and generates captions by investigating their\nrelationships using a label-attention module.

    "summary": "Self-attention is a key enabler of state-of-art accuracy for various\ntransformer-based Natural Language Processing models. This attention mechanism\ncalculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in\na sentence. Commonly, only a small subset of words highly correlates with the\nword under attention, which is only determined at runtime. As such, a\nsignificant amount of computation is inconsequential due to low attention\nscores and can potentially be pruned. The main challenge is finding the\nthreshold for the scores below which subsequent computation will be\ninconsequential. Although such a threshold is discrete, this paper formulates\nits search through a soft differentiable regularizer integrated into the loss\nfunction of the training. This formulation piggy backs on the back-propagation\ntraining to analytically co-optimize the threshold and the weights\nsimultaneously, striking a formally optimal balance between accuracy and\ncomputation pruning. To best utilize this mathematical innovation, we devise a\nbit-serial architecture, dubbed LeOPArd, for transformer language models with\nbit-level early termination microarchitectural mechanism.

    "summary": "Image captioning aims to automatically generate a natural language\ndescription of a given image, and most state-of-the-art models have adopted an\nencoder-decoder framework. The framework consists of a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN)-based image encoder that extracts region-based visual features\nfrom the input image, and an recurrent neural network (RNN)-based caption\ndecoder that generates the output caption words based on the visual features\nwith the attention mechanism. Despite the success of existing studies, current\nmethods only model the co-attention that characterizes the inter-modal\ninteractions while neglecting the self-attention that characterizes the\nintra-modal interactions. Inspired by the success of the Transformer model in\nmachine translation, here we extend it to a Multimodal Transformer (MT) model\nfor image captioning. Compared to existing image captioning approaches, the MT\nmodel simultaneously captures intra- and inter-modal interactions in a unified\nattention block. Due to the in-depth modular composition of such attention\nblocks, the MT model can perform complex multimodal reasoning and output\naccurate captions. Moreover, to further improve the image captioning\nperformance, multi-view visual features are seamlessly introduced into the MT\nmodel. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our approach using the\nbenchmark MSCOCO image captioning dataset and conduct extensive ablation\nstudies to investigate the reasons behind its effectiveness. The experimental\nresults show that our method significantly outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "summary": "Existing Transformer-based RGBT tracking methods either use cross-attention\nto fuse the two modalities, or use self-attention and cross-attention to model\nboth modality-specific and modality-sharing information. However, the\nsignificant appearance gap between modalities limits the feature representation\nability of certain modalities during the fusion process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Progressive Fusion Transformer called ProFormer,\nwhich progressively integrates single-modality information into the multimodal\nrepresentation for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, ProFormer first uses a\nself-attention module to collaboratively extract the multimodal representation,\nand then uses two cross-attention modules to interact it with the features of\nthe dual modalities respectively. In this way, the modality-specific\ninformation can well be activated in the multimodal representation. Finally, a\nfeed-forward network is used to fuse two interacted multimodal representations\nfor the further enhancement of the final multimodal representation. In\naddition, existing learning methods of RGBT trackers either fuse multimodal\nfeatures into one for final classification, or exploit the relationship between\nunimodal branches and fused branch through a competitive learning strategy.\nHowever, they either ignore the learning of single-modality branches or result\nin one branch failing to be well optimized. To solve these problems, we propose\na dynamically guided learning algorithm that adaptively uses well-performing\nbranches to guide the learning of other branches, for enhancing the\nrepresentation ability of each branch.

    "summary": "Recent studies indicate that hierarchical Vision Transformer with a macro\narchitecture of interleaved non-overlapped window-based self-attention \\&\nshifted-window operation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in\nvarious visual recognition tasks, and challenges the ubiquitous convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) using densely slid kernels. Most follow-up works attempt\nto replace the shifted-window operation with other kinds of cross-window\ncommunication paradigms, while treating self-attention as the de-facto standard\nfor window-based information aggregation. In this manuscript, we question\nwhether self-attention is the only choice for hierarchical Vision Transformer\nto attain strong performance, and the effects of different kinds of\ncross-window communication. To this end, we replace self-attention layers with\nembarrassingly simple linear mapping layers, and the resulting proof-of-concept\narchitecture termed as LinMapper can achieve very strong performance in\nImageNet-1k image recognition. Moreover, we find that LinMapper is able to\nbetter leverage the pre-trained representations from image recognition and\ndemonstrates excellent transfer learning properties on downstream dense\nprediction tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation. We also\nexperiment with other alternatives to self-attention for content aggregation\ninside each non-overlapped window under different cross-window communication\napproaches, which all give similar competitive results. Our study reveals that\nthe \\textbf{macro architecture} of Swin model families, other than specific\naggregation layers or specific means of cross-window communication, may be more\nresponsible for its strong performance and is the real challenger to the\nubiquitous CNN's dense sliding window paradigm. Code and models will be\npublicly available to facilitate future research.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity\nor low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and\nmemory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging\nto balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a\none-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this\ntrade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in\ndifferent regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and\nsparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical\nrobust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose\nScatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and\nlow-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient\napproximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We\nempirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines\nwhen serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and\npre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without\nfine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of\nonly 1% drop in accuracy.

    "summary": "While transformers have shown great potential on video recognition with their\nstrong capability of capturing long-range dependencies, they often suffer high\ncomputational costs induced by the self-attention to the huge number of 3D\ntokens. In this paper, we present a new transformer architecture termed\nDualFormer, which can efficiently perform space-time attention for video\nrecognition. Concretely, DualFormer stratifies the full space-time attention\ninto dual cascaded levels, i.e., to first learn fine-grained local interactions\namong nearby 3D tokens, and then to capture coarse-grained global dependencies\nbetween the query token and global pyramid contexts. Different from existing\nmethods that apply space-time factorization or restrict attention computations\nwithin local windows for improving efficiency, our local-global stratification\nstrategy can well capture both short- and long-range spatiotemporal\ndependencies, and meanwhile greatly reduces the number of keys and values in\nattention computation to boost efficiency. Experimental results verify the\nsuperiority of DualFormer on five video benchmarks against existing methods. In\nparticular, DualFormer achieves 82.9%/85.2% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600\nwith ~1000G inference FLOPs which is at least 3.2x fewer than existing methods\nwith similar performance.

In this work,\nto determine whether a better feature fusion method exists than correlation, a\nnovel attention-based feature fusion network, inspired by the transformer, is\npresented. This network effectively combines the template and search region\nfeatures using attention. Specifically, the proposed method includes an\nego-context augment module based on self-attention and a cross-feature augment\nmodule based on cross-attention. First, we present a transformer tracking\n(named TransT) method based on the Siamese-like feature extraction backbone,\nthe designed attention-based fusion mechanism, and the classification and\nregression head. Based on the TransT baseline, we further design a segmentation\nbranch to generate an accurate mask.

Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation\nhas two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the\nvolumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are\nmissing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays\nand pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field\n(NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On\nthe one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft\nfeature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the\ntransformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA\nperforms multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the\ninteractions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance\nover NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D.\nBesides, NeRFA establishes a new state-of-the-art under two settings: the\nsingle-scene view synthesis and the category-centric novel view synthesis.",

This is often achieved via exemplar replay which can help\nrecalibrate previous task classifiers to the feature drift which occurs when\nlearning new tasks. Exemplar replay, however, comes at the cost of retaining\nsamples from previous tasks which for many applications may not be possible. To\naddress the problem of continual ViT training, we first propose gated\nclass-attention to minimize the drift in the final ViT transformer block. This\nmask-based gating is applied to class-attention mechanism of the last\ntransformer block and strongly regulates the weights crucial for previous\ntasks. Importantly, gated class-attention does not require the task-ID during\ninference, which distinguishes it from other parameter isolation methods.\nSecondly, we propose a new method of feature drift compensation that\naccommodates feature drift in the backbone when learning new tasks. The\ncombination of gated class-attention and cascaded feature drift compensation\nallows for plasticity towards new tasks while limiting forgetting of previous\nones. Extensive experiments performed on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and\nImageNet100 demonstrate that our exemplar-free method obtains competitive\nresults when compared to rehearsal based ViT methods.",

    "summary": "Many studies have been conducted to improve the efficiency of Transformer\nfrom quadric to linear. Among them, the low-rank-based methods aim to learn the\nprojection matrices to compress the sequence length. However, the projection\nmatrices are fixed once they have been learned, which compress sequence length\nwith dedicated coefficients for tokens in the same position. Adopting such\ninput-invariant projections ignores the fact that the most informative part of\na sequence varies from sequence to sequence, thus failing to preserve the most\nuseful information that lies in varied positions. In addition, previous\nefficient Transformers only focus on the influence of sequence length while\nneglecting the effect of hidden state dimension. To address the aforementioned\nproblems, we present an efficient yet effective attention mechanism, namely the\nDynamic Bilinear Low-Rank Attention (DBA), which compresses the sequence length\nby input-sensitive dynamic projection matrices and achieves linear time and\nspace complexity by jointly optimizing the sequence length and hidden state\ndimension while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we\nfirst theoretically demonstrate that the sequence length can be compressed\nnon-destructively from a novel perspective of information theory, with\ncompression matrices dynamically determined by the input sequence. Furthermore,\nwe show that the hidden state dimension can be approximated by extending the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, optimizing the attention in bilinear form.\nTheoretical analysis shows that DBA is proficient in capturing high-order\nrelations in cross-attention problems.

    "summary": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently attracted\nconsiderable attention because it requires fewer annotations than fully\nsupervised approaches, making it especially promising for large-scale image\nsegmentation tasks. Although many vision transformer-based methods leverage\nself-attention affinity matrices to refine Class Activation Maps (CAMs), they\noften treat each layer's affinity equally and thus introduce considerable\nbackground noise at deeper layers, where attention tends to converge\nexcessively on certain tokens (i.e., over-smoothing). We observe that this\ndeep-level attention naturally converges on a subset of tokens, yet unregulated\nquery-key affinity can generate unpredictable activation patterns\n(undisciplined over-smoothing), adversely affecting CAM accuracy. To address\nthese limitations, we propose an Adaptive Re-Activation Mechanism (AReAM),\nwhich exploits shallow-level affinity to guide deeper-layer convergence in an\nentropy-aware manner, thereby suppressing background noise and re-activating\ncrucial semantic regions in the CAMs. Experiments on two commonly used datasets\ndemonstrate that AReAM substantially improves segmentation performance compared\nwith existing WSSS methods, reducing noise while sharpening focus on relevant\nsemantic regions. Overall, this work underscores the importance of controlling\ndeep-level attention to mitigate undisciplined over-smoothing, introduces an\nentropy-aware mechanism that harmonizes shallow and deep-level affinities, and\nprovides a refined approach to enhance transformer-based WSSS accuracy by\nre-activating CAMs.",

    "summary": "In the current landscape of large models, the Transformer stands as a\ncornerstone, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern models.\nHowever, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial\ncomputational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its\nreliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles,\nparticularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing\nenvironments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices\nand a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions.\n  To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we\nintroduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer\nparadigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that\nadeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise\noperations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does\nit maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range\ninformation dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the\ncomputational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition\nfrom an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an\n$O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this\nadvantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller\nthan the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$.\n  The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable\nrequirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge\ncomputing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between\nhigh-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a\npromising trajectory for further advancements in the field.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised\nvideo object segmentation (VOS). Our key insight is that the inherent\nstructural dependencies present in DINO-pretrained Transformers can be\nleveraged to establish robust spatio-temporal correspondences in videos.\nFurthermore, simple clustering on this correspondence cue is sufficient to\nyield competitive segmentation results. Previous self-supervised VOS techniques\nmajorly resort to auxiliary modalities or utilize iterative slot attention to\nassist in object discovery, which restricts their general applicability and\nimposes higher computational requirements. To deal with these challenges, we\ndevelop a simplified architecture that capitalizes on the emerging objectness\nfrom DINO-pretrained Transformers, bypassing the need for additional modalities\nor slot attention. Specifically, we first introduce a single spatio-temporal\nTransformer block to process the frame-wise DINO features and establish\nspatio-temporal dependencies in the form of self-attention. Subsequently,\nutilizing these attention maps, we implement hierarchical clustering to\ngenerate object segmentation masks. To train the spatio-temporal block in a\nfully self-supervised manner, we employ semantic and dynamic motion consistency\ncoupled with entropy normalization. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple unsupervised VOS benchmarks and particularly excels\nin complex real-world multi-object video segmentation tasks such as\nDAVIS-17-Unsupervised and YouTube-VIS-19.

In this\npaper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that\nleverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference\nefficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified\ninto two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where\nonly spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output,\nand (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different\nframes dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling\nstrategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of\nattention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout\ntransformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x\nand 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively,\nwhile preserving generation quality.

    "summary": "Transformers have become the backbone of neural network architecture for most\nmachine learning applications. Their widespread use has resulted in multiple\nefforts on accelerating attention, the basic building block of transformers.\nThis paper tackles the challenges associated with accelerating attention\nthrough a hardware-software co-design approach while leveraging\ncompute-in-memory(CIM) architecture. In particular, our energy- and\narea-efficient CIM based accelerator, named HASTILY, aims to accelerate softmax\ncomputation, an integral operation in attention, and minimize their high\non-chip memory requirements that grows quadratically with input sequence\nlength. Our architecture consists of novel CIM units called unified compute and\nlookup modules(UCLMs) that integrate both lookup and multiply-accumulate\nfunctionality within the same SRAM array, incurring minimal area overhead over\nstandard CIM arrays. Designed in TSMC 65nm, UCLMs can be used to concurrently\nperform exponential and matrix-vector multiplication operations. Complementing\nthe proposed architecture, HASTILY features a fine-grained pipelining strategy\nfor scheduling both attention and feed-forward layers, to reduce the quadratic\ndependence on sequence length to linear dependence. Further, for fast softmax\ncomputation which involves computing the maxima and sum of exponential values,\nsuch operations are parallelized across multiple cores using reduce and gather\nstrategy. We evaluate our proposed architecture using a compiler tailored\ntowards attention computation and a standard cycle-level CIM simulator. Our\nevaluation shows end-to-end throughput(TOPS) improvement of 4.4x-9.8x and\n1.7x-5.9x over Nvidia A40 GPU and baseline CIM hardware, respectively, for BERT\nmodels with INT-8 precision. Additionally, it shows gains of 16x-36x in\nenergy-efficiency(TOPS/W) over A40 GPU and similar energy-efficiency as\nbaseline CIM hardware.",

To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based\nefficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to\nlearn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by\nestimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the\ncomplexity will be reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where\n$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$.

In this paper, we ask the following question: is it\npossible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding\ntheir respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional\nself-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be\nequipped with a ``soft\" convolutional inductive bias. We initialise the GPSA\nlayers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention\nhead the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating\nthe attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting\nconvolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet,\nwhile offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the\nrole of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in\nvanilla self-attention layers, then analysing how it is escaped in GPSA layers.\nWe conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of\nthe ConViT.

    "summary": "In this new digital era, social media has created a severe impact on the\nlives of people. In recent times, fake news content on social media has become\none of the major challenging problems for society. The dissemination of\nfabricated and false news articles includes multimodal data in the form of text\nand images. The previous methods have mainly focused on unimodal analysis.\nMoreover, for multimodal analysis, researchers fail to keep the unique\ncharacteristics corresponding to each modality. This paper aims to overcome\nthese limitations by proposing an Efficient Transformer based Multilevel\nAttention (ETMA) framework for multimodal fake news detection, which comprises\nthe following components: visual attention-based encoder, textual\nattention-based encoder, and joint attention-based learning. Each component\nutilizes the different forms of attention mechanism and uniquely deals with\nmultimodal data to detect fraudulent content. The efficacy of the proposed\nnetwork is validated by conducting several experiments on four real-world fake\nnews datasets: Twitter, Jruvika Fake News Dataset, Pontes Fake News Dataset,\nand Risdal Fake News Dataset using multiple evaluation metrics. The results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods on all four\ndatasets. Further, the computation time of the model is also lower than the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

To train the GATCluster in a\ncompletely unsupervised manner, we design four self-learning tasks with the\nconstraints of transformation invariance, separability maximization, entropy\nanalysis, and attention mapping.

    "summary": "Facial expression recognition (FER) has received increasing interest in\ncomputer vision. We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich\nrelation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components:\nMulti-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping\n(MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various\nexpressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse\nlocal patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible\ndue to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is\nproposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to\nexplore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations\nbetween different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER,\ncalled ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a\nbetter representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the\nmulti-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from\ndifferent information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit\nguidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To\naddress this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module.\nAs a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local\npatches.

The patch\nembedding based tokenizer has a semantic gap with respect to its counterpart,\nthe textual tokenizer.

Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute\nposition and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even\nvanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of\nabsolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of\nDoc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer\n(P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information\nin both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute\npositional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs\nboth in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective\naddition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in\nself-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position\nencoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment\nembedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a\nDoc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and\ncompletely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)\nway. In addition, P-Transformer can be applied to seq2seq-based\ndocument-to-sentence (Doc2Sent) and sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent)\ntranslation.

However, their performance in\nmulti-view 3D object detection remains inferior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nof convolutional neural network based detectors. In this work, we investigate\nthis issue from the perspective of bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature generation.\nSpecifically, we examine the BEV feature generation method employed by the\ntransformer-based SOTA, BEVFormer, and identify its two limitations: (i) it\nonly generates attention weights from BEV, which precludes the use of lidar\npoints for supervision, and (ii) it aggregates camera view features to the BEV\nthrough deformable sampling, which only selects a small subset of features and\nfails to exploit all information.

This method encodes all\ncamera features into the BEV feature. By combining dual-view attention with the\nBEVFormer architecture, we build a new detector named VoxelFormer. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on the nuScenes benchmark to verify the superiority\nof dual-view attention and VoxelForer.

However, compared to the Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) models, it has been observed that the ViT models struggle to\ncapture high-frequency components of images, which can limit their ability to\ndetect local textures and edge information. As abnormalities in human tissue,\nsuch as tumors and lesions, may greatly vary in structure, texture, and shape,\nhigh-frequency information such as texture is crucial for effective semantic\nsegmentation tasks. To address this limitation in ViT models, we propose a new\ntechnique, Laplacian-Former, that enhances the self-attention map by adaptively\nre-calibrating the frequency information in a Laplacian pyramid. More\nspecifically, our proposed method utilizes a dual attention mechanism via\nefficient attention and frequency attention while the efficient attention\nmechanism reduces the complexity of self-attention to linear while producing\nthe same output, selectively intensifying the contribution of shape and texture\nfeatures.

    "title": "Class-Discriminative Attention Maps for Vision Transformers",
    "summary": "Importance estimators are explainability methods that quantify feature\nimportance for deep neural networks (DNN). In vision transformers (ViT), the\nself-attention mechanism naturally leads to attention maps, which are sometimes\ninterpreted as importance scores that indicate which input features ViT models\nare focusing on. However, attention maps do not account for signals from\ndownstream tasks. To generate explanations that are sensitive to downstream\ntasks, we have developed class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM), a\ngradient-based extension that estimates feature importance with respect to a\nknown class or a latent concept. CDAM scales attention scores by how relevant\nthe corresponding tokens are for the predictions of a classifier head. In\naddition to targeting the supervised classifier, CDAM can explain an arbitrary\nconcept shared by selected samples by measuring similarity in the latent space\nof ViT. Additionally, we introduce Smooth CDAM and Integrated CDAM, which\naverage a series of CDAMs with slightly altered tokens. Our quantitative\nbenchmarks include correctness, compactness, and class sensitivity, in\ncomparison to 7 other importance estimators. Vanilla, Smooth, and Integrated\nCDAM excel across all three benchmarks. In particular, our results suggest that\nexisting importance estimators may not provide sufficient class-sensitivity. We\ndemonstrate the utility of CDAM in medical images by training and explaining\nmalignancy and biomarker prediction models based on lung Computed Tomography\n(CT) scans. Overall, CDAM is shown to be highly class-discriminative and\nsemantically relevant, while providing compact explanations.",

    "summary": "Modern language models rely on the transformer architecture and attention\nmechanism to perform language understanding and text generation. In this work,\nwe study learning a 1-layer self-attention model from a set of prompts and\nassociated output data sampled from the model. We first establish a precise\nmapping between the self-attention mechanism and Markov models: Inputting a\nprompt to the model samples the output token according to a context-conditioned\nMarkov chain (CCMC) which weights the transition matrix of a base Markov chain.\nAdditionally, incorporating positional encoding results in position-dependent\nscaling of the transition probabilities. Building on this formalism, we develop\nidentifiability/coverage conditions for the prompt distribution that guarantee\nconsistent estimation and establish sample complexity guarantees under IID\nsamples. Finally, we study the problem of learning from a single output\ntrajectory generated from an initial prompt. We characterize an intriguing\nwinner-takes-all phenomenon where the generative process implemented by\nself-attention collapses into sampling a limited subset of tokens due to its\nnon-mixing nature. This provides a mathematical explanation to the tendency of\nmodern LLMs to generate repetitive text. In summary, the equivalence to CCMC\nprovides a simple but powerful framework to study self-attention and its\nproperties.",

    "summary": "Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is a crucial task for ensuring the safety\nand efficiency of industrial processes. We propose a novel FDD methodology for\nthe Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a widely used benchmark for chemical\nprocess control. The model employs two separate Transformer branches, enabling\nindependent processing of input data and potential extraction of diverse\ninformation. A novel attention mechanism, Gated Dynamic Learnable Attention\n(GDLAttention), is introduced which integrates a gating mechanism and dynamic\nlearning capabilities. The gating mechanism modulates the attention weights,\nallowing the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input. The\ndynamic learning approach adapts the attention strategy during training,\npotentially leading to improved performance. The attention mechanism uses a\nbilinear similarity function, providing greater flexibility in capturing\ncomplex relationships between query and key vectors. In order to assess the\neffectiveness of our approach, we tested it against 21 and 18 distinct fault\nscenarios in TEP, and compared its performance with several established FDD\ntechniques. The outcomes indicate that the method outperforms others in terms\nof accuracy, false alarm rate, and misclassification rate.

In this paper, we propose a multi-view attention consistency\nmethod that computes the similarity between two attentions from two different\nviews of the action videos using Directed Gromov-Wasserstein Discrepancy.\nFurthermore, our approach applies the idea of Neural Radiance Field to\nimplicitly render the features from novel views when training on single-view\ndatasets. Therefore, the contributions in this work are three-fold. Firstly, we\nintroduce the multi-view attention consistency to solve the problem of\nreasonable prediction in action recognition.

This paper introduces the Object-level Attention Transformer\n(OAT), which predicts human scanpaths as they search for a target object within\na cluttered scene of distractors. OAT uses an encoder-decoder architecture. The\nencoder captures information about the position and appearance of the objects\nwithin an image and about the target. The decoder predicts the gaze scanpath as\na sequence of object fixations, by integrating output features from both the\nencoder and decoder.

OAT's\npredicted gaze scanpaths align more closely with human gaze patterns, compared\nto predictions by algorithms based on spatial attention on both established\nmetrics and a novel behavioural-based metric.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via\nself-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.\nWhile sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,\nthey often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,\nwe first propose dual-state linear attention (DSLA), a novel design that\nmaintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving historical context\nand one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the short-range bias typical of\nlinear-attention architectures. To further balance efficiency and accuracy\nunder dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive\ndistillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA\nlayers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering.\nDSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly\nconverted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers,\npreserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning,\nlong-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x\nfaster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while\nretaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies\nshow that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,\naddressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear\nattentions.

    "summary": "The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning, delivering the\nstate-of-the-art performance in areas such as natural language processing,\ncomputer vision, and time series prediction. However, its core component,\nself-attention, has the quadratic time complexity relative to input sequence\nlength, which hinders the scalability of Transformers. The exsiting approaches\non optimizing self-attention either discard full-contextual information or lack\nof flexibility. In this work, we design DistrAttention, an effcient and\nflexible self-attention mechanism with the full context. DistrAttention\nachieves this by grouping data on the embedding dimensionality, usually\nreferred to as $d$. We realize DistrAttention with a lightweight sampling and\nfusion method that exploits locality-sensitive hashing to group similar data. A\nblock-wise grouping framework is further designed to limit the errors\nintroduced by locality sensitive hashing. By optimizing the selection of block\nsizes, DistrAttention could be easily integrated with FlashAttention-2, gaining\nhigh-performance on modern GPUs. We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive\nexperiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than\nFlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,\nDistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate\nself-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the\nlowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes GluMind, a transformer-based multimodal framework\ndesigned for continual and long-term blood glucose forecasting. GluMind devises\ntwo attention mechanisms, including cross-attention and multi-scale attention,\nwhich operate in parallel and deliver accurate predictive performance.\nCross-attention effectively integrates blood glucose data with other\nphysiological and behavioral signals such as activity, stress, and heart rate,\naddressing challenges associated with varying sampling rates and their adverse\nimpacts on robust prediction.

    "summary": "Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to\ntime-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of\nphysical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by\nreplacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned\nprediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show\nlimited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce\nDecoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the\nfunction space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the\npredictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes\nsimilarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.\nThus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining\nkernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the\nattention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results\ndemonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample\nvalidation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation\nloss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the\nrole of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,\nshowing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based\ncounterparts.

Differential Attention\naddressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but\nits required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on\nrepresentational flexibility and scalability.\n  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel\napproach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving\nand noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by\nstrategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to\nnoise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to\nGQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational\noverhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a\nscalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,\nthereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.\n  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we\ndemonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial\nimprovements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.\nOur results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and\nselective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing\nscalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are proliferating rapidly at the edge,\ndelivering intelligent capabilities across diverse application scenarios.\nHowever, their practical deployment in collaborative scenarios confronts\nfundamental challenges: privacy vulnerabilities, communication overhead, and\ncomputational bottlenecks. To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

    "summary": "Transformers have sprung up in the field of computer vision. In this work, we\nexplore whether the core self-attention module in Transformer is the key to\nachieving excellent performance in image recognition. To this end, we build an\nattention-free network called sMLPNet based on the existing MLP-based vision\nmodels. Specifically, we replace the MLP module in the token-mixing step with a\nnovel sparse MLP (sMLP) module. For 2D image tokens, sMLP applies 1D MLP along\nthe axial directions and the parameters are shared among rows or columns. By\nsparse connection and weight sharing, sMLP module significantly reduces the\nnumber of model parameters and computational complexity, avoiding the common\nover-fitting problem that plagues the performance of MLP-like models. When only\ntrained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, the proposed sMLPNet achieves 81.9% top-1\naccuracy with only 24M parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and\nvision Transformers under the same model size constraint. When scaling up to\n66M parameters, sMLPNet achieves 83.4% top-1 accuracy, which is on par with the\nstate-of-the-art Swin Transformer.

The Transformer has recently been extended and applied to\nseveral bi-modal tasks, yielding promising results. For visual dialog, it\nbecomes necessary to consider interactions between three or more inputs, i.e.,\nan image, a question, and a dialog history, or even its individual dialog\ncomponents. In this paper, we present a neural architecture named Light-weight\nTransformer for Many Inputs (LTMI) that can efficiently deal with all the\ninteractions between multiple such inputs in visual dialog.

    "title": "Learning Texture Transformer Network for Image Super-Resolution",
    "summary": "We study on image super-resolution (SR), which aims to recover realistic\ntextures from a low-resolution (LR) image. Recent progress has been made by\ntaking high-resolution images as references (Ref), so that relevant textures\ncan be transferred to LR images. However, existing SR approaches neglect to use\nattention mechanisms to transfer high-resolution (HR) textures from Ref images,\nwhich limits these approaches in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Texture Transformer Network for Image Super-Resolution (TTSR), in which\nthe LR and Ref images are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer,\nrespectively. TTSR consists of four closely-related modules optimized for image\ngeneration tasks, including a learnable texture extractor by DNN, a relevance\nembedding module, a hard-attention module for texture transfer, and a\nsoft-attention module for texture synthesis. Such a design encourages joint\nfeature learning across LR and Ref images, in which deep feature\ncorrespondences can be discovered by attention, and thus accurate texture\nfeatures can be transferred. The proposed texture transformer can be further\nstacked in a cross-scale way, which enables texture recovery from different\nlevels (e.g., from 1x to 4x magnification). Extensive experiments show that\nTTSR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on both\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

We focus on graph-based transformer models for MDS as they\ngained recent popularity. We aim to improve the explainability of the\ngraph-based MDS by analyzing their attention weights. In a graph-based MDS such\nas GraphSum, vertices represent the textual units, while the edges form some\nsimilarity graph over the units. We compare GraphSum's performance utilizing\ndifferent textual units, i. e., sentences versus paragraphs, on two news\nbenchmark datasets, namely WikiSum and MultiNews. Our experiments show that\nparagraph-level representations provide the best summarization performance.\nThus, we subsequently focus oAnalysisn analyzing the paragraph-level attention\nweights of GraphSum's multi-heads and decoding layers in order to improve the\nexplainability of a transformer-based MDS model. As a reference metric, we\ncalculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in\nthe generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text\nsimilarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and\nthis reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the\ntransformer architecture.

Unlike\nconvolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous\nyears, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies\nin the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the\nself-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory\nutilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To\nalleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ\nself-attention on non-interleaving windows.

In this paper, we propose a new\nshift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that\naggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions.\nThe key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and\nefficient implementation.

Much\nof the merit is attributable to positional encoding and multi-head attention.\nHowever, Transformers fall short in learning long-range dependencies mainly due\nto the quadratic complexity scaled with context length, in terms of both time\nand space. Consequently, over the past five years, a myriad of methods has been\nproposed to make Transformers more efficient. In this work, we first take a\nstep back, study and compare existing solutions to long-sequence modeling in\nterms of their pure mathematical formulation. Specifically, we summarize them\nusing a unified template, given their shared nature of token mixing. Through\nbenchmarks, we then demonstrate that long context length does yield better\nperformance, albeit application-dependent, and traditional Transformer models\nfall short in taking advantage of long-range dependencies. Next, inspired by\nemerging sparse models of huge capacity, we propose a machine learning system\nfor handling million-scale dependencies. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the\nperformance of one essential component of this system, namely, the distributed\nmulti-head attention.

    "title": "From Saliency to DINO: Saliency-guided Vision Transformer for Few-shot\n  Keypoint Detection",
    "summary": "Unlike current deep keypoint detectors that are trained to recognize limited\nnumber of body parts, few-shot keypoint detection (FSKD) attempts to localize\nany keypoints, including novel or base keypoints, depending on the reference\nsamples. FSKD requires the semantically meaningful relations for keypoint\nsimilarity learning to overcome the ubiquitous noise and ambiguous local\npatterns. One rescue comes with vision transformer (ViT) as it captures\nlong-range relations well. However, ViT may model irrelevant features outside\nof the region of interest due to the global attention matrix, thus degrading\nsimilarity learning between support and query features. In this paper, we\npresent a novel saliency-guided vision transformer, dubbed SalViT, for few-shot\nkeypoint detection. Our SalViT enjoys a uniquely designed masked self-attention\nand a morphology learner, where the former introduces saliency map as a soft\nmask to constrain the self-attention on foregrounds, while the latter leverages\nthe so-called power normalization to adjust morphology of saliency map,\nrealizing ``dynamically changing receptive field''. Moreover, as salinecy\ndetectors add computations, we show that attentive masks of DINO transformer\ncan replace saliency. On top of SalViT, we also investigate i) transductive\nFSKD that enhances keypoint representations with unlabelled data and ii) FSKD\nunder occlusions. We show that our model performs well on five public datasets\nand achieves ~10% PCK higher than the normally trained model under severe\nocclusions.",

    "summary": "Object detection on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images, as an emerging\nsolution to facilitate robust detection for around-the-clock applications, has\nreceived extensive attention in recent years. With the help of IR images,\nobject detectors have been more reliable and robust in practical applications\nby using RGB-IR combined information. However, existing methods still suffer\nfrom modality miscalibration and fusion imprecision problems. Since transformer\nhas the powerful capability to model the pairwise correlations between\ndifferent features, in this paper, we propose a novel Calibrated and\nComplementary Transformer called $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former to address these two\nproblems simultaneously. In $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former, we design an Inter-modality\nCross-Attention (ICA) module to obtain the calibrated and complementary\nfeatures by learning the cross-attention relationship between the RGB and IR\nmodality. To reduce the computational cost caused by computing the global\nattention in ICA, an Adaptive Feature Sampling (AFS) module is introduced to\ndecrease the dimension of feature maps. Because $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former performs\nin the feature domain, it can be embedded into existed RGB-IR object detectors\nvia the backbone network. Thus, one single-stage and one two-stage object\ndetector both incorporating our $\\mathrm{C}^2$Former are constructed to\nevaluate its effectiveness and versatility. With extensive experiments on the\nDroneVehicle and KAIST RGB-IR datasets, we verify that our method can fully\nutilize the RGB-IR complementary information and achieve robust detection\nresults.

Motivated by the success of\nTransformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based\nattention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of\ninfinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting\ndistribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE)\nindexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic\nlimit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the\nSoftmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent\ntemperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the\ncorresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be\nelegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a\nstable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very\nlarge depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy\nin deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE\nprovides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size\nmodel.

Accurate segmentation of\nanatomical structures and abnormalities from medical images can aid in the\nearly detection and treatment of various diseases. In this paper, we address\nthe local feature deficiency of the Transformer model by carefully re-designing\nthe self-attention map to produce accurate dense prediction in medical images.\nTo this end, we first apply the wavelet transformation to decompose the input\nfeature map into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) subbands. The LF\nsegment is associated with coarse-grained features while the HF components\npreserve fine-grained features such as texture and edge information. Next, we\nreformulate the self-attention operation using the efficient Transformer to\nperform both spatial and context attention on top of the frequency\nrepresentation. Furthermore, to intensify the importance of the boundary\ninformation, we impose an additional attention map by creating a Gaussian\npyramid on top of the HF components.

We focus on two self-attention mechanisms: (1) UHAT\n(Unique Hard Attention Transformers) and (2) AHAT (Average Hard Attention\nTransformers).

    "summary": "While models derived from Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been phonemically\nsurging, pre-trained models cannot seamlessly adapt to arbitrary resolution\nimages without altering the architecture and configuration, such as sampling\nthe positional encoding, limiting their flexibility for various vision tasks.\nFor instance, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) based on ViT-Huge requires all\ninput images to be resized to 1024$\\times$1024. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose the Multi-Head Self-Attention Convolution (MSA-Conv) that incorporates\nSelf-Attention within generalized convolutions, including standard, dilated,\nand depthwise ones. Enabling transformers to handle images of varying sizes\nwithout retraining or rescaling, the use of MSA-Conv further reduces\ncomputational costs compared to global attention in ViT, which grows costly as\nimage size increases. Later, we present the Vision Transformer in Convolution\n(TiC) as a proof of concept for image classification with MSA-Conv, where two\ncapacity enhancing strategies, namely Multi-Directional Cyclic Shifted\nMechanism and Inter-Pooling Mechanism, have been proposed, through establishing\nlong-distance connections between tokens and enlarging the effective receptive\nfield. Extensive experiments have been carried out to validate the overall\neffectiveness of TiC.

    "summary": "As one of the most popular neural network modules, Transformer plays a\ncentral role in many fundamental deep learning models, e.g., the ViT in\ncomputer vision and the BERT and GPT in natural language processing. The\neffectiveness of the Transformer is often attributed to its multi-head\nattention (MHA) mechanism. In this study, we discuss the limitations of MHA,\nincluding the high computational complexity due to its ``query-key-value''\narchitecture and the numerical issue caused by its softmax operation.\nConsidering the above problems and the recent development tendency of the\nattention layer, we propose an effective and efficient surrogate of the\nTransformer, called Sliceformer. Our Sliceformer replaces the classic MHA\nmechanism with an extremely simple ``slicing-sorting'' operation, i.e.,\nprojecting inputs linearly to a latent space and sorting them along different\nfeature dimensions (or equivalently, called channels). For each feature\ndimension, the sorting operation implicitly generates an implicit attention map\nwith sparse, full-rank, and doubly-stochastic structures. We consider different\nimplementations of the slicing-sorting operation and analyze their impacts on\nthe Sliceformer. We test the Sliceformer in the Long-Range Arena benchmark,\nimage classification, text classification, and molecular property prediction,\ndemonstrating its advantage in computational complexity and universal\neffectiveness in discriminative tasks. Our Sliceformer achieves comparable or\nbetter performance with lower memory cost and faster speed than the Transformer\nand its variants. Moreover, the experimental results reveal that applying our\nSliceformer can empirically suppress the risk of mode collapse when\nrepresenting data.

    "title": "ConDaFormer: Disassembled Transformer with Local Structure Enhancement\n  for 3D Point Cloud Understanding",
    "summary": "Transformers have been recently explored for 3D point cloud understanding\nwith impressive progress achieved. A large number of points, over 0.1 million,\nmake the global self-attention infeasible for point cloud data. Thus, most\nmethods propose to apply the transformer in a local region, e.g., spherical or\ncubic window. However, it still contains a large number of Query-Key pairs,\nwhich requires high computational costs. In addition, previous methods usually\nlearn the query, key, and value using a linear projection without modeling the\nlocal 3D geometric structure. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the costs and\nmodel the local geometry prior by developing a new transformer block, named\nConDaFormer. Technically, ConDaFormer disassembles the cubic window into three\northogonal 2D planes, leading to fewer points when modeling the attention in a\nsimilar range. The disassembling operation is beneficial to enlarging the range\nof attention without increasing the computational complexity, but ignores some\ncontexts. To provide a remedy, we develop a local structure enhancement\nstrategy that introduces a depth-wise convolution before and after the\nattention. This scheme can also capture the local geometric information. Taking\nadvantage of these designs, ConDaFormer captures both long-range contextual\ninformation and local priors. The effectiveness is demonstrated by experimental\nresults on several 3D point cloud understanding benchmarks. Code is available\nat https://github.com/LHDuan/ConDaFormer .",

Graph transformers have\nmade strides in addressing this by leveraging graph-based modeling, but they\noften lose or insufficiently represent spatial hierarchies, especially since\nredundant or less relevant areas dilute the image's contextual representation.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose SAG-ViT, a Scale-Aware Graph Attention ViT that\nintegrates multi-scale feature capabilities of CNNs, representational power of\nViTs, graph-attended patching to enable richer contextual representation. Using\nEfficientNetV2 as a backbone, the model extracts multi-scale feature maps,\ndividing them into patches to preserve richer semantic information compared to\ndirectly patching the input images. The patches are structured into a graph\nusing spatial and feature similarities, where a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\nrefines the node embeddings. This refined graph representation is then\nprocessed by a Transformer encoder, capturing long-range dependencies and\ncomplex interactions. We evaluate SAG-ViT on benchmark datasets across various\ndomains, validating its effectiveness in advancing image classification tasks.\nOur code and weights are available at https://github.com/shravan-18/SAG-ViT.",

    "summary": "Continual learning (CL) aims to efficiently learn from a non-stationary data\nstream, without storing or recomputing all seen samples. CL enables prediction\non new tasks by incorporating sequential training samples. Building on this\nconnection between CL and sequential modeling, meta-continual learning (MCL)\naims to meta-learn an efficient continual learner as a sequence prediction\nmodel, with advanced sequence models like Transformers being natural choices.\nHowever, despite decent performance, Transformers rely on a linearly growing\ncache to store all past representations, conflicting with CL's objective of not\nstoring all seen samples and limiting efficiency. In this paper, we focus on\nmeta-learning sequence-prediction-based continual learners without retaining\nall past representations. While attention-free models with fixed-size hidden\nstates (e.g., Linear Transformers) align with CL's essential goal and\nefficiency needs, they have shown limited effectiveness in MCL in previous\nliterature. Given Mamba's strong sequence modeling performance and\nattention-free nature, we explore a key question: Can attention-free models\nlike Mamba perform well on MCL? By formulating Mamba and the SSM for MCL tasks,\nwe propose MambaCL, a meta-learned continual learner. To enhance MambaCL's\ntraining, we introduce selectivity regularization, leveraging the connection\nbetween Mamba and Transformers to guide its behavior over sequences.\nFurthermore, we study how Mamba and other models perform across various MCL\nscenarios through extensive and well-designed experiments. Our results\nhighlight the promising performance and strong generalization of Mamba and\nattention-free models in MCL, demonstrating its potential for efficient\ncontinual learning and adaptation.",

The\nTransformer uses the attention mechanism that computes the pair-wise similarity\nbetween its input tokens to produce latent vectors that are able to understand\nthe semantic meaning of the input text. One of the challenges in the\nTransformer architecture is the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism\nthat prohibits the efficient processing of long sequence lengths.

In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR that was proposed\nfor Auto-Regressive modeling as a baseline, and provide three different\narchitectural enhancements to it with varying computation overhead tradeoffs.\nInspired by the recently proposed efficient attention computation approach of\nLong-LoRA, we then present an equally efficient Perceiver-based architecture\n(termed as Long LoRA Pereceiver - LLP) that can be used as the base\narchitecture in LLMs instead of just a fine-tuning add-on.

Large\ntransformer models like the Swin Transformers excel in plant disease\nclassification by capturing global-local dependencies. However, their\ncomputational complexity (34.1 GFLOPs) limits applications and renders them\nimpractical for real-time on-device inference. Lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV3 and TinyML would be suitable for on-device inference but lack the\nrequired spatial reasoning for fine-grained disease detection. To bridge this\ngap, we propose a hybrid knowledge distillation framework that synergistically\ntransfers logit and attention knowledge from a Swin Transformer teacher to a\nMobileNetV3 student model. Our method includes the introduction of adaptive\nattention alignment to resolve cross-architecture mismatch (resolution,\nchannels) and a dual-loss function optimizing both class probabilities and\nspatial focus. On the lantVillage-Tomato dataset (18,160 images), the distilled\nMobileNetV3 attains 92.4% accuracy relative to 95.9% for Swin-L but at an 95%\nreduction on PC and < 82% in inference latency on IoT devices.

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps\nchallenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to\nintegrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To\naddress this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment\nTransformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and\nalignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and\nglobal-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and\nbetween paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction\nand fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the\nTransformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial\npixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel\ndependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain\ndistribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature\nmisalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive\nAlignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in\na two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity.\nThis reduces the information gap within and between paradigms.

Second, they usually either adopt full\nattention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational\ncosts, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to\nsuboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an\nefficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a\npyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image\nrecognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks\nsuch as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates\nhierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of\nfeature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces\na novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to\nimprove computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining\nhigh performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is designed\nto explicitly attend to the most relevant content. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that MedFormer outperforms existing medical vision transformers in\nterms of generality and efficiency.

    "summary": "Chord recognition is an important task since chords are highly abstract and\ndescriptive features of music. For effective chord recognition, it is essential\nto utilize relevant context in audio sequence. While various machine learning\nmodels such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) have been employed for the task, most of them have limitations\nin capturing long-term dependency or require training of an additional model.\nIn this work, we utilize a self-attention mechanism for chord recognition to\nfocus on certain regions of chords. Training of the proposed bi-directional\nTransformer for chord recognition (BTC) consists of a single phase while\nshowing competitive performance. Through an attention map analysis, we have\nvisualized how attention was performed. It turns out that the model was able to\ndivide segments of chords by utilizing adaptive receptive field of the\nattention mechanism. Furthermore, it was observed that the model was able to\neffectively capture long-term dependencies, making use of essential information\nregardless of distance.",

To address this issue, we propose a non-autoregressive end-to-end\nspeech recognition system called LASO (listen attentively, and spell once).\nBecause of the non-autoregressive property, LASO predicts a textual token in\nthe sequence without the dependence on other tokens. Without beam-search, the\none-pass propagation much reduces inference time cost of LASO. And because the\nmodel is based on the attention based feedforward structure, the computation\ncan be implemented in parallel efficiently. We conduct experiments on publicly\navailable Chinese dataset AISHELL-1. LASO achieves a character error rate of\n6.4%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer model\n(6.7%).

    "summary": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims at predicting object\nlocations in an image using only image-level category labels. Common challenges\nthat image classification models encounter when localizing objects are, (a)\nthey tend to look at the most discriminative features in an image that confines\nthe localization map to a very small region, (b) the localization maps are\nclass agnostic, and the models highlight objects of multiple classes in the\nsame image and, (c) the localization performance is affected by background\nnoise. To alleviate the above challenges we introduce the following simple\nchanges through our proposed method ViTOL. We leverage the vision-based\ntransformer for self-attention and introduce a patch-based attention dropout\nlayer (p-ADL) to increase the coverage of the localization map and a gradient\nattention rollout mechanism to generate class-dependent attention maps.

To effectively combine the strengths from both\narchitectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced \"coat\" nets), a family of hybrid\nmodels built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and\nself-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2)\nvertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way\nis surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency.\nExperiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under\ndifferent resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data,\nCoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M\nimages from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching\nViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data;\nNotably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.",

However, the dominant\nsequence-to-sequence (S2S) E2E model is still hard to fully utilize the\nself-supervised pre-training methods because its decoder is conditioned on\nacoustic representation thus cannot be pretrained separately.

In our framework, the encoder is initialized\nwith a pretrained AM (wav2vec2.0). The Preformer leverages CTC as an auxiliary\ntask during training and inference. Furthermore, we design a one-cross decoder\n(OCD), which relaxes the dependence on acoustic representations so that it can\nbe initialized with pretrained LM (DistilGPT2).

Transformer\nbased models have recently bested RNN and CNN models in speech enhancement,\nhowever at the same time they are much more computationally expensive and\nrequire much more high quality training data, which is always hard to come by.\nIn this paper, we present an improvement for speech enhancement models that\nmaintains the expressiveness of self-attention while significantly reducing\nmodel complexity, which we have termed Spectrum Attention Fusion. We carefully\nconstruct a convolutional module to replace several self-attention layers in a\nspeech Transformer, allowing the model to more efficiently fuse spectral\nfeatures. Our proposed model is able to achieve comparable or better results\nagainst SOTA models but with significantly smaller parameters (0.58M) on the\nVoice Bank + DEMAND dataset.",

However, traditional CNN-based flow architectures rely only\non local information to extract features, making it difficult to capture global\ncontextual information. Inspired by the wide adoption of Transformers, we\nexplored the complementary roles of self-attention mechanisms in Transformers,\nCNN, and continuous normalizing flows. To this end, we propose a probabilistic\nmodel via adaptive normalizing flows and self-attention. Our idea leverages\nself-attention mechanisms to capture global contextual information. We also\npropose adaptive continuous normalizing flows by introducing adaptive bias\ncorrection mechanism. Combined with normalization, the mechanism dynamically\nhandles different input contexts and mitigates potential bias-shift issues from\nstandard initialization. Experimental results demonstrate that EAGLE achieves\ncompetitive performance in point cloud generation.",

To enhance the integration of the parser\nwithin IRNet, we propose Intra Parser-Prompted Attention (IntraPPA) and Inter\nParser-Prompted Attention (InterPPA) to implicitly and explicitly learn useful\nparser features to facilitate restoration. The IntraPPA re-considers cross\nattention between parser and restoration features, enabling implicit perception\nof the parser from a long-range and intra-layer perspective. Conversely, the\nInterPPA initially fuses restoration features with those of the parser,\nfollowed by formulating these fused features within an attention mechanism to\nexplicitly perceive parser information.

To address these bottlenecks,\nwe introduce ScaleKV, a novel KV cache compression framework tailored for VAR\narchitectures. ScaleKV leverages two critical observations: varying cache\ndemands across transformer layers and distinct attention patterns at different\nscales. Based on these insights, ScaleKV categorizes transformer layers into\ntwo functional groups: drafters and refiners. Drafters exhibit dispersed\nattention across multiple scales, thereby requiring greater cache capacity.\nConversely, refiners focus attention on the current token map to process local\ndetails, consequently necessitating substantially reduced cache capacity.\nScaleKV optimizes the multi-scale inference pipeline by identifying\nscale-specific drafters and refiners, facilitating differentiated cache\nmanagement tailored to each scale. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art\ntext-to-image VAR model family, Infinity, demonstrates that our approach\neffectively reduces the required KV cache memory to 10% while preserving\npixel-level fidelity.",

    "summary": "Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global\nClass token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative\ncontrol and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework\nthat addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative\nlinchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global\nlatent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level\nlatent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics\ndirectly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from\nopinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of\ninteracting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a\nconvergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's\ninfluence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables\na principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded\ndiagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster\nfunctional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to\nsignificantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity.

Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is\nnot a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of\nsimilar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the\ncompounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision\narithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error\naccumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training\ndynamics.

    "summary": "The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where\nthe vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive\nfor each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for\nenhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in\ntranslating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved\naway from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing\nefforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,\nincrease parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from\nenforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the\nGemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on\nstandard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN\nneurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This\nsparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time\nspeedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.",

    "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have triggered the most recent and significant\nbreakthroughs in computer vision. Their efficient designs are mostly guided by\nthe indirect metric of computational complexity, i.e., FLOPs, which however has\na clear gap with the direct metric such as throughput. Thus, we propose to use\nthe direct speed evaluation on the target platform as the design principle for\nefficient ViTs. Particularly, we introduce LITv2, a simple and effective ViT\nwhich performs favourably against the existing state-of-the-art methods across\na spectrum of different model sizes with faster speed. At the core of LITv2 is\na novel self-attention mechanism, which we dub HiLo. HiLo is inspired by the\ninsight that high frequencies in an image capture local fine details and low\nfrequencies focus on global structures, whereas a multi-head self-attention\nlayer neglects the characteristic of different frequencies. Therefore, we\npropose to disentangle the high/low frequency patterns in an attention layer by\nseparating the heads into two groups, where one group encodes high frequencies\nvia self-attention within each local window, and another group encodes low\nfrequencies by performing global attention between the average-pooled\nlow-frequency keys and values from each window and each query position in the\ninput feature map. Benefiting from the efficient design for both groups, we\nshow that HiLo is superior to the existing attention mechanisms by\ncomprehensively benchmarking FLOPs, speed and memory consumption on GPUs and\nCPUs. For example, HiLo is 1.4x faster than spatial reduction attention and\n1.6x faster than local window attention on CPUs. Powered by HiLo, LITv2 serves\nas a strong backbone for mainstream vision tasks including image\nclassification, dense detection and segmentation.

    "summary": "Inspired by the tremendous success of the self-attention mechanism in natural\nlanguage processing, the Vision Transformer (ViT) creatively applies it to\nimage patch sequences and achieves incredible performance. However, the scaled\ndot-product self-attention of ViT brings about scale ambiguity to the structure\nof the original feature space. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nmethod named Orthogonal Vision Transformer (O-ViT), to optimize ViT from the\ngeometric perspective. O-ViT limits parameters of self-attention blocks to be\non the norm-keeping orthogonal manifold, which can keep the geometry of the\nfeature space. Moreover, O-ViT achieves both orthogonal constraints and cheap\noptimization overhead by adopting a surjective mapping between the orthogonal\ngroup and its Lie algebra.We have conducted comparative experiments on image\nrecognition tasks to demonstrate O-ViT's validity and experiments show that\nO-ViT can boost the performance of ViT by up to 3.6%.",

    "summary": "Transformers have become a default architecture in computer vision, but\nunderstanding what drives their predictions remains a challenging problem.\nCurrent explanation approaches rely on attention values or input gradients, but\nthese provide a limited view of a model's dependencies. Shapley values offer a\ntheoretically sound alternative, but their computational cost makes them\nimpractical for large, high-dimensional models. In this work, we aim to make\nShapley values practical for vision transformers (ViTs).

Specifically, we impose a\nProbabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) parameterized by the attention operations\non each self-attention layer to incorporate sparse assumption. We use this PGM\nto softly segment an input sequence into a few clusters where each cluster can\nbe treated as the parent of the inside entities. By stacking these PGM\nconstrained self-attention layers, the clusters in a lower layer compose into a\nnew sequence, and the PGM in a higher layer will further segment this sequence.\nIteratively, a sparse tree can be implicitly parsed, and this tree's\nhierarchical knowledge is incorporated into the transformed embeddings, which\ncan be used for solving the target vision-language tasks. Specifically, we\nshowcase that our APN can strengthen Transformer based networks in two major\nvision-language tasks: Captioning and Visual Question Answering. Also, a PGM\nprobability-based parsing algorithm is developed by which we can discover what\nthe hidden structure of input is during the inference.",

    "summary": "Although many approaches for multi-human pose estimation in videos have shown\nprofound results, they require densely annotated data which entails excessive\nman labor. Furthermore, there exists occlusion and motion blur that inevitably\nlead to poor estimation performance. To address these problems, we propose a\nmethod that leverages an attention mask for occluded joints and encodes\ntemporal dependency between frames using transformers. First, our framework\ncomposes different combinations of sparsely annotated frames that denote the\ntrack of the overall joint movement. We propose an occlusion attention mask\nfrom these combinations that enable encoding occlusion-aware heatmaps as a\nsemi-supervised task. Second, the proposed temporal encoder employs transformer\narchitecture to effectively aggregate the temporal relationship and\nkeypoint-wise attention from each time step and accurately refines the target\nframe's final pose estimation. We achieve state-of-the-art pose estimation\nresults for PoseTrack2017 and PoseTrack2018 datasets and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our approach to occlusion and motion blur in sparsely annotated\nvideo data.",

    "summary": "Understanding the link between urban planning and commuting flows is crucial\nfor guiding urban development and policymaking. This research, bridging\ncomputer science and urban studies, addresses the challenge of integrating\nthese fields with their distinct focuses. Traditional urban studies methods,\nlike the gravity and radiation models, often underperform in complex scenarios\ndue to their limited handling of multiple variables and reliance on overly\nsimplistic and unrealistic assumptions, such as spatial isotropy. While deep\nlearning models offer improved accuracy, their black-box nature poses a\ntrade-off between performance and explainability -- both vital for analyzing\ncomplex societal phenomena like commuting flows. To address this, we introduce\nTransFlower, an explainable, transformer-based model employing flow-to-flow\nattention to predict urban commuting patterns. It features a geospatial encoder\nwith an anisotropy-aware relative location encoder for nuanced flow\nrepresentation. Following this, the transformer-based flow predictor enhances\nthis by leveraging attention mechanisms to efficiently capture flow\ninteractions.

    "summary": "Transformer-based architectures have recently advanced the image\nreconstruction quality of super-resolution (SR) models.

Across\nmultiple SR benchmarks, TaylorIR delivers state-of-the-art performance while\nreducing memory consumption by up to 60%, effectively bridging the gap between\nfine-grained detail restoration and efficient transformer scaling.",

Unlike human cognition, which can encode and dynamically recall\nsymbolic templates, Generative Pretrained Transformers rely solely on fixed\npretrained weights and ephemeral context windows, limiting their adaptability.\nThe proposed Retention Layer incorporates a persistent memory module capable of\nreal time data population, dynamic recall, and guided output generation. This\nenhancement allows models to store, update, and reuse observed patterns across\nsessions, enabling incremental learning and bridging the gap between static\npretraining and dynamic, context sensitive adaptation. The Retention Layer\ndesign parallels social learning processes, encompassing attention, retention,\nreproduction, and motivation stages. Technically, it integrates a memory\nattention mechanism and episodic buffers to manage memory scalability, mitigate\noverfitting, and ensure efficient recall. Applications span adaptive personal\nassistants, real time fraud detection, autonomous robotics, content moderation,\nand healthcare diagnostics. In each domain, the retention mechanism enables\nsystems to learn incrementally, personalize outputs, and respond to evolving\nreal world challenges effectively.

A standard transformer model incorporating\nrelative positional encoding for molecular graphs when scaled to 25 million\nparameters surpasses the current state-of-the-art non-equivariant base model\nwith 64 million parameters on the GEOM-DRUGS benchmark. We implemented relative\npositional encoding as a negative attention bias that linearly increases with\nthe shortest path distances between graph nodes at varying slopes for different\nattention heads, similar to ALiBi, a widely adopted relative positional\nencoding technique in the NLP domain. This architecture has the potential to\nserve as a foundation for a novel class of generative models for molecular\nconformations.",

The substantial memory\nand computational requirements make them unsuitable for real-time applications,\nhighlighting the need to improve the completeness and accuracy of depth\ninformation while improving processing speed to enhance robot performance in\nvarious tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose\nCHADET(cross-hierarchical-attention depth-completion transformer), a\nlightweight depth-completion network that can generate accurate dense depth\nmaps from RGB images and sparse depth points. For each pair, its feature is\nextracted from the depthwise blocks and passed to the equally lightweight\ntransformer-based decoder.

To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured\nAttention Block in this paper.

Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two\nmechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical\ncharacteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity,\nyield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph,\nwhile allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting\ntransformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the\nrecently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical\nresults on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results\non three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger\ngraphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures. Code can be\nfound at \\url{https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer}.",

    "summary": "Despite the great promise of Transformers in many sequence modeling tasks\n(e.g., machine translation), their deterministic nature hinders them from\ngeneralizing to high entropy tasks such as dialogue response generation.\nPrevious work proposes to capture the variability of dialogue responses with a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN)-based conditional variational autoencoder\n(CVAE). However, the autoregressive computation of the RNN limits the training\nefficiency. Therefore, we propose the Variational Transformer (VT), a\nvariational self-attentive feed-forward sequence model. The VT combines the\nparallelizability and global receptive field of the Transformer with the\nvariational nature of the CVAE by incorporating stochastic latent variables\ninto Transformers. We explore two types of the VT: 1) modeling the\ndiscourse-level diversity with a global latent variable; and 2) augmenting the\nTransformer decoder with a sequence of fine-grained latent variables. Then, the\nproposed models are evaluated on three conversational datasets with both\nautomatic metric and human evaluation. The experimental results show that our\nmodels improve standard Transformers and other baselines in terms of diversity,\nsemantic relevance, and human judgment.",

Alternatively, we rethink this task from a\nconvolution-free sequence-to-sequence perspective and predict saliency by\nmodeling long-range dependencies, which can not be achieved by convolution.\nSpecifically, we develop a novel unified model based on a pure transformer,\nnamely, Visual Saliency Transformer (VST), for both RGB and RGB-D salient\nobject detection (SOD). It takes image patches as inputs and leverages the\ntransformer to propagate global contexts among image patches. Unlike\nconventional architectures used in Vision Transformer (ViT), we leverage\nmulti-level token fusion and propose a new token upsampling method under the\ntransformer framework to get high-resolution detection results. We also develop\na token-based multi-task decoder to simultaneously perform saliency and\nboundary detection by introducing task-related tokens and a novel\npatch-task-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our model\noutperforms existing methods on both RGB and RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets.

The crux lies in the limited depth of\napplying Transformer in the typical encoder-decoder framework for image\nrestoration, resulting from heavy self-attention computation load and\ninefficient communications across different depth (scales) of layers. In this\npaper, we present a deep and effective Transformer-based network for image\nrestoration, termed as U2-Former, which is able to employ Transformer as the\ncore operation to perform image restoration in a deep encoding and decoding\nspace.

    "summary": "Hybrid Mamba-Transformer networks have recently garnered broad attention.\nThese networks can leverage the scalability of Transformers while capitalizing\non Mamba's strengths in long-context modeling and computational efficiency.\nHowever, the challenge of effectively pretraining such hybrid networks remains\nan open question. Existing methods, such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) or\nautoregressive (AR) pretraining, primarily focus on single-type network\narchitectures. In contrast, pretraining strategies for hybrid architectures\nmust be effective for both Mamba and Transformer components. Based on this, we\npropose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid\nMamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths\nof both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba\nand Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Experimental results show\nthat the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP\nsignificantly outperforms other pretraining strategies, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. We validate the method's effectiveness on both 2D\nand 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design\nchoices for each component.

    "summary": "Multi-dimensional time series data, such as matrix and tensor-variate time\nseries, are increasingly prevalent in fields such as economics, finance, and\nclimate science. Traditional Transformer models, though adept with sequential\ndata, do not effectively preserve these multi-dimensional structures, as their\ninternal operations in effect flatten multi-dimensional observations into\nvectors, thereby losing critical multi-dimensional relationships and patterns.\nTo address this, we introduce the Tensor-Augmented Transformer (TEAFormer), a\nnovel method that incorporates tensor expansion and compression within the\nTransformer framework to maintain and leverage the inherent multi-dimensional\nstructures, thus reducing computational costs and improving prediction\naccuracy. The core feature of the TEAFormer, the Tensor-Augmentation (TEA)\nmodule, utilizes tensor expansion to enhance multi-view feature learning and\ntensor compression for efficient information aggregation and reduced\ncomputational load. The TEA module is not just a specific model architecture\nbut a versatile component that is highly compatible with the attention\nmechanism and the encoder-decoder structure of Transformers, making it\nadaptable to existing Transformer architectures. Our comprehensive experiments,\nwhich integrate the TEA module into three popular time series Transformer\nmodels across three real-world benchmarks, show significant performance\nenhancements, highlighting the potential of TEAFormers for cutting-edge time\nseries forecasting.",

Convolutional\nneural network (CNN) models are widely utilized for accelerated MRI\nreconstruction, but those models are limited in capturing global correlations\ndue to the intrinsic locality of the convolution operation. The\nself-attention-based transformer models are capable of capturing global\ncorrelations among image features, however, the current contributions of\ntransformer models for MRI reconstruction are minute.

A novel MHSA inference\nschedule, named Fused-Weight Self-Attention, is introduced, fusing the linear\nprojection weights offline to further reduce the number of operations and\nparameters. Furthermore, to mitigate the memory peak reached by the computation\nof the attention map, we present a Depth-First Tiling scheme for MHSA. We\nevaluate our framework on three different MCU classes exploiting ARM and RISC-V\nISA, namely the STM32H7, the STM32L4, and GAP9 (RV32IMC-XpulpV2). We reach an\naverage of 4.79x and 2.0x lower latency compared to SotA libraries CMSIS-NN\n(ARM) and PULP-NN (RISC-V), respectively. Moreover, we show that our MHSA\ndepth-first tiling scheme reduces the memory peak by up to 6.19x, while the\nfused-weight attention can reduce the runtime by 1.53x, and number of\nparameters by 25%. We report significant improvements across several Tiny\nTransformers: for instance, when executing a transformer block for the task of\nradar-based hand-gesture recognition on GAP9, we achieve a latency of 0.14ms\nand energy consumption of 4.92 micro-joules, 2.32x lower than the SotA PULP-NN\nlibrary on the same platform.",

    "summary": "Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains,\nincluding predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption,\nand traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting\nproblem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our\npreliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics:\nthe point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture\nis insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in\ntime series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer\ngrows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long\ntime series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose\nconvolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal\nconvolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention\nmechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$\nmemory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine\ngranularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\nOur experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it\ncompares favorably to the state-of-the-art.",

Recently,\ntransformer-based models demonstrated outstanding potential for learning\nhigh-order contextual relationships from natural images with general resolution\n(224x224 pixels) and achieved remarkable results on general image\nclassification tasks. However, the complexity of the naive transformer grows\nquadratically with the increase in image size, which prevents transformer-based\nmodels from VHR RS image (500x500 pixels) classification and other\ncomputationally expensive downstream tasks. To this end, we propose to\ndecompose the expensive self-attention (SA) into real and imaginary parts via\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) and therefore propose an efficient complex\nself-attention (CSA) mechanism. Benefiting from the conjugated symmetric\nproperty of DFT, CSA is capable to model the high-order contextual information\nwith less than half computations of naive SA. To overcome the gradient\nexplosion in Fourier complex field, we replace the Softmax function with the\ncarefully designed Logmax function to normalize the attention map of CSA and\nstabilize the gradient propagation.

In this work, we present\nSpatial Prior-enhanced Self-Attention (SP-SA), a novel variant of vanilla\nSelf-Attention (SA) tailored for vision transformers. Spatial Priors (SPs) are\nour proposed family of inductive biases that highlight certain groups of\nspatial relations.

Such a hierarchical patch mechanism not\nonly explicitly enables feature aggregation at multiple resolutions but also\nadaptively learns patch-aware features for different image regions, e.g., using\na smaller patch for areas with fine details and a larger patch for textureless\nregions. Meanwhile, a new attention-based position encoding scheme for\nTransformer is proposed to let the network focus on which tokens should be paid\nmore attention by assigning different weights to different tokens, which is the\nfirst time to our best knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose a new\nmulti-reception field attention module to enlarge the convolution reception\nfield from different branches. The experimental results on several public\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed HIPA over\nprevious methods quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "summary": "Vision Transformers have witnessed prevailing success in a series of vision\ntasks. However, these Transformers often rely on extensive computational costs\nto achieve high performance, which is burdensome to deploy on\nresource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we draw lessons from\ndepthwise separable convolution and imitate its ideology to design an efficient\nTransformer backbone, i.e., Separable Vision Transformer, abbreviated as\nSepViT. SepViT helps to carry out the local-global information interaction\nwithin and among the windows in sequential order via a depthwise separable\nself-attention. The novel window token embedding and grouped self-attention are\nemployed to compute the attention relationship among windows with negligible\ncost and establish long-range visual interactions across multiple windows,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments on general-purpose vision benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SepViT can achieve a state-of-the-art trade-off between\nperformance and latency. Among them, SepViT achieves 84.2% top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1K classification while decreasing the latency by 40%, compared to the\nones with similar accuracy (e.g., CSWin). Furthermore, SepViT achieves 51.0%\nmIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation task, 47.9 AP on the RetinaNet-based COCO\ndetection task, 49.4 box AP and 44.6 mask AP on Mask R-CNN-based COCO object\ndetection and instance segmentation tasks.",

    "summary": "Optical flow estimation aims to find the 2D motion field by identifying\ncorresponding pixels between two images. Despite the tremendous progress of\ndeep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately\nestimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the\ncorrelation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product\nof the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional\nfeatures makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On\nlarge displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe\nerrors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new\narchitecture \"CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer\" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize\nthe correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer\nlayer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and\nsemantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced\nwith transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises\nthrough the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations.\nOn Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new\nstate-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different\nmodels on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input\nimages to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs\nmuch more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA. The code of\nCRAFT is is available at https://github.com/askerlee/craft.",

    "summary": "Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL), which aims to localize objects\nby only using image-level labels, has attracted much attention because of its\nlow annotation cost in real applications. Recent studies leverage the advantage\nof self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active\nsemantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class\nactivation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer\nneglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses\nthe semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization\nresults significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate\nWSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial\nrelationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a\nlearnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial\ncontext intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is\ndesigned as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during\ninference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization\nability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through\noptimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to\ncapture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant\nbackground area.

    "summary": "Transformers have been widely used for video processing owing to the\nmulti-head self attention (MHSA) mechanism. However, the MHSA mechanism\nencounters an intrinsic difficulty for video inpainting, since the features\nassociated with the corrupted regions are degraded and incur inaccurate self\nattention. This problem, termed query degradation, may be mitigated by first\ncompleting optical flows and then using the flows to guide the self attention,\nwhich was verified in our previous work - flow-guided transformer (FGT). We\nfurther exploit the flow guidance and propose FGT++ to pursue more effective\nand efficient video inpainting. First, we design a lightweight flow completion\nnetwork by using local aggregation and edge loss. Second, to address the query\ndegradation, we propose a flow guidance feature integration module, which uses\nthe motion discrepancy to enhance the features, together with a flow-guided\nfeature propagation module that warps the features according to the flows.\nThird, we decouple the transformer along the temporal and spatial dimensions,\nwhere flows are used to select the tokens through a temporally deformable MHSA\nmechanism, and global tokens are combined with the inner-window local tokens\nthrough a dual perspective MHSA mechanism. FGT++ is experimentally evaluated to\nbe outperforming the existing video inpainting networks qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",

In practice, however, the input text of many NLP tasks\ncan be seen as a sequence of related segments (e.g., the sequence of sentences\nwithin a passage, or the hypothesis and premise in NLI). While attending across\nthese segments is highly beneficial for many tasks, we hypothesize that this\ninteraction can be delayed until later encoding stages.\n  To this end, we introduce Layer-Adjustable Interactions in Transformers\n(LAIT). Within LAIT, segmented inputs are first encoded independently, and then\njointly. This partial two-tower architecture bridges the gap between a Dual\nEncoder's ability to pre-compute representations for segments and a fully\nself-attentive Transformer's capacity to model cross-segment attention. The\nLAIT framework effectively leverages existing pretrained Transformers and\nconverts them into the hybrid of the two aforementioned architectures, allowing\nfor easy and intuitive control over the performance-efficiency tradeoff.\nExperimenting on a wide range of NLP tasks, we find LAIT able to reduce 30-50%\nof the attention FLOPs on many tasks, while preserving high accuracy; in some\npractical settings, LAIT could reduce actual latency by orders of magnitude.",

    "summary": "Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals plays a crucial\nrole in the early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. While\nECG signals can be used for the diagnosis of various diseases, their\npathological characteristics exhibit minimal variations, posing a challenge to\nautomatic classification models. Existing methods primarily utilize\nconvolutional neural networks to extract ECG signal features for\nclassification, which may not fully capture the pathological feature\ndifferences of different diseases. Transformer networks have advantages in\nfeature extraction for sequence data, but the complete network is complex and\nrelies on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a\nsingle-layer Transformer network called Multi-Scale Shifted Windows Transformer\nNetworks (MSW-Transformer), which uses a multi-window sliding attention\nmechanism at different scales to capture features in different dimensions. The\nself-attention is restricted to non-overlapping local windows via shifted\nwindows, and different window scales have different receptive fields. A\nlearnable feature fusion method is then proposed to integrate features from\ndifferent windows to further enhance model performance. Furthermore, we\nvisualize the attention mechanism of the multi-window shifted mechanism to\nachieve better clinical interpretation in the ECG classification task.

Adding\nto that success, transformer architecture has found widespread interest from\ncomputer vision (CV) researchers and practitioners, allowing for many\nadvancements in vision-related tasks and opening the door for multitask and\nmulti-modal deep learning architectures that share the same principle of\noperation. One drawback to these architectures is their reliance on the scaled\ndot product attention mechanism with the softmax activation function, which is\ncomputationally expensive and requires large compute capabilities for both\ntraining and inference. This paper investigates substituting the MLP and\nattention mechanism usually adopted for transformer architecture with an\narchitecture based on incorporating a gated linear unit (GLU) activation\nfunction structure with the aim of reducing the computational cost. The\nequalized experimental assessments conducted in this work show that the\nproposed modification with the targeted reductions in computational complexity\noffers competitive performance compared to the selected baseline architectures.\nThe results are significantly in support of the aims of this work, in which the\nfocus was to extensively utilize GLU-based MLPs, establishing a more efficient\nbut capable alternative to the traditional MLP and the attention mechanism as\nthe core component in the design of transformer architectures.",

    "title": "Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration",
    "summary": "Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed\nsignificant advancements through deep models that effectively model global\ninformation. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further\npropelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a\ncornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from\nsemantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces\ncomputational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input\nresolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding\nefficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a\ndegraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide\nparticularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they\ncontribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the\nkey semantics via Transformer for IR (\\ie, SemanIR) in this paper.\nSpecifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive\nkey-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential\nsemantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is\nshared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This\nstrategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing\nexclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic\ndictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational\ncomplexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm\nthe proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and\nqualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained\nmodels are available at https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR.",

In these settings,\ntraditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this,\nresearchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models\nto account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures\nto account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two\napproaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of\neven moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough\nTransformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on\ncontinuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly\nlower computational costs. In particular, we propose multi-view signature\nattention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to\ncapture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data,\nwhile remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency\nand yielding improved spatial processing.

This work\nproposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a\nnovel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our\nmethod enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving\n${O}(N \\log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method\nscales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of\nthe Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token\npermutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We\nbenchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body\nsimulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping\ndataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU\nmemory size, speed, and accuracy.",

    "summary": "Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension\nto time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient\nconsideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time\nseries data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two\nkey but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional\ninfluence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying\ninfluence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the\nattention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core\ninnovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),\ndesigned to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints\nof the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a\nframework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic\ndependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.\nExtensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that\nTimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to\na 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new\nbenchmarks on 94.04\\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the\nMoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other\nTransformer-based models.",

    "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for\ngraph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack\nquantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN\ntypes across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component\nselection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance\ngains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious\ncorrelations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural\nencoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while\nkeys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use\nDifferentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at\neach layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention\nitself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first\nquantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our\nmetrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and\nnodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across\neight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while\nremaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing\ndataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual\nattention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating\nwidely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.\nCrucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced\nmore interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers\nneed not choose between performance and interpretability.",

In this paper, we aim at introducing multiple\ntypes of structural priors into SAN models, proposing the Multiple Structural\nPriors Guided Self Attention Network (MS-SAN) that transforms different\nstructural priors into different attention heads by using a novel multi-mask\nbased multi-head attention mechanism.

    "title": "Interpretable Crowd Flow Prediction with Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention",
    "summary": "Crowd flow prediction has been increasingly investigated in intelligent urban\ncomputing field as a fundamental component of urban management system. The most\nchallenging part of predicting crowd flow is to measure the complicated\nspatial-temporal dependencies. A prevalent solution employed in current methods\nis to divide and conquer the spatial and temporal information by various\narchitectures (e.g., CNN/GCN, LSTM). However, this strategy has two\ndisadvantages: (1) the sophisticated dependencies are also divided and\ntherefore partially isolated; (2) the spatial-temporal features are transformed\ninto latent representations when passing through different architectures,\nmaking it hard to interpret the predicted crowd flow. To address these issues,\nwe propose a Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Network (STSAN) with an ST\nencoding gate that calculates the entire spatial-temporal representation with\npositional and time encodings and therefore avoids dividing the dependencies.\nFurthermore, we develop a Multi-aspect attention mechanism that applies scaled\ndot-product attention over spatial-temporal information and measures the\nattention weights that explicitly indicate the dependencies. Experimental\nresults on traffic and mobile data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces\ninflow and outflow RMSE by 16% and 8% on the Taxi-NYC dataset compared to the\nSOTA baselines.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a novel Motion-Attentive Transition Network\n(MATNet) for zero-shot video object segmentation, which provides a new way of\nleveraging motion information to reinforce spatio-temporal object\nrepresentation. An asymmetric attention block, called Motion-Attentive\nTransition (MAT), is designed within a two-stream encoder, which transforms\nappearance features into motion-attentive representations at each convolutional\nstage. In this way, the encoder becomes deeply interleaved, allowing for\nclosely hierarchical interactions between object motion and appearance. This is\nsuperior to the typical two-stream architecture, which treats motion and\nappearance separately in each stream and often suffers from overfitting to\nappearance information. Additionally, a bridge network is proposed to obtain a\ncompact, discriminative and scale-sensitive representation for multi-level\nencoder features, which is further fed into a decoder to achieve segmentation\nresults. Extensive experiments on three challenging public benchmarks (i.e.\nDAVIS-16, FBMS and Youtube-Objects) show that our model achieves compelling\nperformance against the state-of-the-arts.",

However, instruction tuning significantly\nenhances the models' sensitivity to instructions. We also find that current\nLLMs are consistently closer to non-native than native speakers in attention,\nsuggesting a sub-optimal language perception of all models.

    "summary": "Considering the attacks against the power grid, one of the most effective\napproaches could be the attack to the transmission lines that leads to large\ncascading failures. Hence, the problem of locating the most critical or\nvulnerable transmission lines for a Power Grid Cascading Failure (PGCF) has\ndrawn much attention from the research society. There exists many deterministic\nsolutions and stochastic approximation algorithms aiming to analyze the power\ngrid vulnerability. However, it has been challenging to reveal the correlations\nbetween the transmission lines to identify the critical ones. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach of learning such correlations via attention mechanism\ninspired by the Transformer based models that were initially designated to\nlearn the correlation of words in sentences. Multiple modifications and\nadjustments are proposed to support the attention mechanism producing an\ninformative correlation matrix, the Attention Matrix. With the Attention\nRanking algorithm, we are able to identify the most critical lines. The\nproposed Dual PGCF model provide a novel and effective analysis to improve the\npower grid resilience against cascading failure, which is proved by extensive\nexperiment results.",

    "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) based text-to-speech (TTS) systems have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling large speech datasets and\ngenerating natural speech for new speakers. However, LLM-based TTS models are\nnot robust as the generated output can contain repeating words, missing words\nand mis-aligned speech (referred to as hallucinations or attention errors),\nespecially when the text contains multiple occurrences of the same token. We\nexamine these challenges in an encoder-decoder transformer model and find that\ncertain cross-attention heads in such models implicitly learn the text and\nspeech alignment when trained for predicting speech tokens for a given text. To\nmake the alignment more robust, we propose techniques utilizing CTC loss and\nattention priors that encourage monotonic cross-attention over the text tokens.\nOur guided attention training technique does not introduce any new learnable\nparameters and significantly improves robustness of LLM-based TTS models.",

    "title": "Inference-time sparse attention with asymmetric indexing",
    "summary": "Self-attention in transformer models is an incremental associative memory\nthat maps key vectors to value vectors. One way to speed up self-attention is\nto employ GPU-compatible vector search algorithms based on standard\npartitioning methods such as k-means. However, such partitioning methods yield\npoor results in this context because (1) the keys and queries follow different\ndistributions, and (2) the RoPE positional encoding hinders the bucket\nassignment.\n  This paper introduces Saap (Self-Attention with Asymmetric Partitions), which\novercomes these problems. It is an asymmetrical indexing technique that employs\ndistinct partitions for keys and queries, thereby approximating self-attention\nwith a data-adaptive sparsity pattern. It works on pretrained language models\nand only requires to train (offline) a small query classifier. On a long\ncontext Llama 3.1-8b model, with sequences ranging from 100k to 500k tokens,\nSaap typically reduces by a factor of 20 the fraction of memory that needs to\nbe looked-up, which translates to a time saving of 60\\% when compared to\nFlashAttention-v2.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to attend heavily to the first token in the\nsequence -- creating a so-called attention sink. Many works have studied this\nphenomenon in detail, proposing various ways to either leverage or alleviate\nit. Attention sinks have been connected to quantisation difficulties, security\nissues, and streaming attention. Yet, while many works have provided conditions\nin which they occur or not, a critical question remains shallowly answered: Why\ndo LLMs learn such patterns and how are they being used? In this work, we argue\ntheoretically and empirically that this mechanism provides a method for LLMs to\navoid over-mixing, connecting this to existing lines of work that study\nmathematically how information propagates in Transformers. We conduct\nexperiments to validate our theoretical intuitions and show how choices such as\ncontext length, depth, and data packing influence the sink behaviour. We hope\nthat this study provides a new practical perspective on why attention sinks are\nuseful in LLMs, leading to a better understanding of the attention patterns\nthat form during training.",

Despite\nsubstantial advancements, including the introduction of transformer-based\narchitectures, current SCD models continue to struggle with challenges such as\nnoisy inputs, subtle class boundaries, and significant class imbalance. In this\nstudy, we propose enhancing the Semantic Change Network (SCanNet) by\nintegrating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and employing Dice\nloss during training. CBAM sequentially applies channel attention to highlight\nfeature maps with the most meaningful content, followed by spatial attention to\npinpoint critical regions within these maps. This sequential approach ensures\nprecise suppression of irrelevant features and spatial noise, resulting in more\naccurate and robust detection performance compared to attention mechanisms that\napply both processes simultaneously or independently. Dice loss, designed\nexplicitly for handling class imbalance, further boosts sensitivity to minority\nchange classes. Quantitative experiments conducted on the SECOND dataset\ndemonstrate consistent improvements.

    "summary": "Hybrid models that combine state space models (SSMs) with attention\nmechanisms have shown strong performance by leveraging the efficiency of SSMs\nand the high recall ability of attention. However, the architectural design\nchoices behind these hybrid models remain insufficiently understood. In this\nwork, we analyze hybrid architectures through the lens of memory utilization\nand overall performance, and propose a complementary method to further enhance\ntheir effectiveness. We first examine the distinction between sequential and\nparallel integration of SSM and attention layers. Our analysis reveals several\ninteresting findings, including that sequential hybrids perform better on\nshorter contexts, whereas parallel hybrids are more effective for longer\ncontexts. We also introduce a data-centric approach of continually training on\ndatasets augmented with paraphrases, which further enhances recall while\npreserving other capabilities. It generalizes well across different base models\nand outperforms architectural modifications aimed at enhancing recall. Our\nfindings provide a deeper understanding of hybrid SSM-attention models and\noffer practical guidance for designing architectures tailored to various use\ncases.

    "title": "Transformers with Competitive Ensembles of Independent Mechanisms",
    "summary": "An important development in deep learning from the earliest MLPs has been a\nmove towards architectures with structural inductive biases which enable the\nmodel to keep distinct sources of information and routes of processing\nwell-separated. This structure is linked to the notion of independent\nmechanisms from the causality literature, in which a mechanism is able to\nretain the same processing as irrelevant aspects of the world are changed. For\nexample, convnets enable separation over positions, while attention-based\narchitectures (especially Transformers) learn which combination of positions to\nprocess dynamically. In this work we explore a way in which the Transformer\narchitecture is deficient: it represents each position with a large monolithic\nhidden representation and a single set of parameters which are applied over the\nentire hidden representation. This potentially throws unrelated sources of\ninformation together, and limits the Transformer's ability to capture\nindependent mechanisms. To address this, we propose Transformers with\nIndependent Mechanisms (TIM), a new Transformer layer which divides the hidden\nrepresentation and parameters into multiple mechanisms, which only exchange\ninformation through attention. Additionally, we propose a competition mechanism\nwhich encourages these mechanisms to specialize over time steps, and thus be\nmore independent. We study TIM on a large-scale BERT model, on the Image\nTransformer, and on speech enhancement and find evidence for semantically\nmeaningful specialization as well as improved performance.",

In this work, we present Object-Region Video Transformers (ORViT), an\n\\emph{object-centric} approach that extends video transformer layers with a\nblock that directly incorporates object representations. The key idea is to\nfuse object-centric representations starting from early layers and propagate\nthem into the transformer-layers, thus affecting the spatio-temporal\nrepresentations throughout the network. Our ORViT block consists of two\nobject-level streams: appearance and dynamics. In the appearance stream, an\n\"Object-Region Attention\" module applies self-attention over the patches and\n\\emph{object regions}. In this way, visual object regions interact with uniform\npatch tokens and enrich them with contextualized object information. We further\nmodel object dynamics via a separate \"Object-Dynamics Module\", which captures\ntrajectory interactions, and show how to integrate the two streams. We evaluate\nour model on four tasks and five datasets: compositional and few-shot action\nrecognition on SomethingElse, spatio-temporal action detection on AVA, and\nstandard action recognition on Something-Something V2, Diving48 and\nEpic-Kitchen100.

    "summary": "Attention-based Transformer models have been increasingly employed for\nautomatic music generation. To condition the generation process of such a model\nwith a user-specified sequence, a popular approach is to take that conditioning\nsequence as a priming sequence and ask a Transformer decoder to generate a\ncontinuation. However, this prompt-based conditioning cannot guarantee that the\nconditioning sequence would develop or even simply repeat itself in the\ngenerated continuation. In this paper, we propose an alternative conditioning\napproach, called theme-based conditioning, that explicitly trains the\nTransformer to treat the conditioning sequence as a thematic material that has\nto manifest itself multiple times in its generation result. This is achieved\nwith two main technical contributions. First, we propose a deep learning-based\napproach that uses contrastive representation learning and clustering to\nautomatically retrieve thematic materials from music pieces in the training\ndata. Second, we propose a novel gated parallel attention module to be used in\na sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder/decoder architecture to more\neffectively account for a given conditioning thematic material in the\ngeneration process of the Transformer decoder.

Nowadays, accurate building extraction\nfrom remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex background\nand diverse appearances of buildings. The convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased building extraction methods, although increased the accuracy\nsignificantly, are criticized for their inability for modelling global\ndependencies. Thus, this paper applies the Vision Transformer for building\nextraction. However, the actual utilization of the Vision Transformer often\ncomes with two limitations. First, the Vision Transformer requires more GPU\nmemory and computational costs compared to CNNs. This limitation is further\nmagnified when encountering large-sized inputs like fine-resolution remote\nsensing images. Second, spatial details are not sufficiently preserved during\nthe feature extraction of the Vision Transformer, resulting in the inability\nfor fine-grained building segmentation. To handle these issues, we propose a\nnovel Vision Transformer (BuildFormer), with a dual-path structure.\nSpecifically, we design a spatial-detailed context path to encode rich spatial\ndetails and a global context path to capture global dependencies. Besides, we\ndevelop a window-based linear multi-head self-attention to make the complexity\nof the multi-head self-attention linear with the window size, which strengthens\nthe global context extraction by using large windows and greatly improves the\npotential of the Vision Transformer in processing large-sized remote sensing\nimages.

However, it is still being\ndetermined whether the Transformer architecture performs equally well in 3D\nshape generation, as previous 3D diffusion methods mostly adopted the U-Net\narchitecture. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer for\n3D shape generation, namely DiT-3D, which can directly operate the denoising\nprocess on voxelized point clouds using plain Transformers. Compared to\nexisting U-Net approaches, our DiT-3D is more scalable in model size and\nproduces much higher quality generations. Specifically, the DiT-3D adopts the\ndesign philosophy of DiT but modifies it by incorporating 3D positional and\npatch embeddings to adaptively aggregate input from voxelized point clouds. To\nreduce the computational cost of self-attention in 3D shape generation, we\nincorporate 3D window attention into Transformer blocks, as the increased 3D\ntoken length resulting from the additional dimension of voxels can lead to high\ncomputation. Finally, linear and devoxelization layers are used to predict the\ndenoised point clouds. In addition, our transformer architecture supports\nefficient fine-tuning from 2D to 3D, where the pre-trained DiT-2D checkpoint on\nImageNet can significantly improve DiT-3D on ShapeNet.

    "summary": "In order to understand the in-context learning phenomenon, recent works have\nadopted a stylized experimental framework and demonstrated that Transformers\ncan learn gradient-based learning algorithms for various classes of real-valued\nfunctions. However, the limitations of Transformers in implementing learning\nalgorithms, and their ability to learn other forms of algorithms are not well\nunderstood. Additionally, the degree to which these capabilities are confined\nto attention-based models is unclear. Furthermore, it remains to be seen\nwhether the insights derived from these stylized settings can be extrapolated\nto pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we take a step\ntowards answering these questions by demonstrating the following: (a) On a\ntest-bed with a variety of Boolean function classes, we find that Transformers\ncan nearly match the optimal learning algorithm for 'simpler' tasks, while\ntheir performance deteriorates on more 'complex' tasks. Additionally, we find\nthat certain attention-free models perform (almost) identically to Transformers\non a range of tasks. (b) When provided a teaching sequence, i.e. a set of\nexamples that uniquely identifies a function in a class, we show that\nTransformers learn more sample-efficiently. Interestingly, our results show\nthat Transformers can learn to implement two distinct algorithms to solve a\nsingle task, and can adaptively select the more sample-efficient algorithm\ndepending on the sequence of in-context examples. (c) Lastly, we show that\nextant LLMs, e.g. LLaMA-2, GPT-4, can compete with nearest-neighbor baselines\non prediction tasks that are guaranteed to not be in their training set.",

    "summary": "Compared to CNN-based methods, Transformer-based methods achieve impressive\nimage restoration outcomes due to their abilities to model remote dependencies.\nHowever, how to apply Transformer-based methods to the field of blind\nsuper-resolution (SR) and further make an SR network adaptive to degradation\ninformation is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose a new\ndegradation-aware self-attention-based Transformer model, where we incorporate\ncontrastive learning into the Transformer network for learning the degradation\nrepresentations of input images with unknown noise. In particular, we integrate\nboth CNN and Transformer components into the SR network, where we first use the\nCNN modulated by the degradation information to extract local features, and\nthen employ the degradation-aware Transformer to extract global semantic\nfeatures. We apply our proposed model to several popular large-scale benchmark\ndatasets for testing, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting methods. In particular, our method yields a PSNR of 32.43 dB on the\nUrban100 dataset at $\\times$2 scale, 0.94 dB higher than DASR, and 26.62 dB on\nthe Urban100 dataset at $\\times$4 scale, 0.26 dB improvement over KDSR, setting\na new benchmark in this area.

    "summary": "Transformer models trained on long sequences often achieve higher accuracy\nthan short sequences. Unfortunately, conventional transformers struggle with\nlong sequence training due to the overwhelming computation and memory\nrequirements. Existing methods for long sequence training offer limited speedup\nand memory reduction, and may compromise accuracy.

It distributes\na long sequence into segments among GPUs, with each GPU computing a partial\nself-attention for its segment. Then, it uses a fused communication and a novel\ndouble gradient averaging technique to avoid the need to aggregate partial\nself-attention and minimize communication overhead. We evaluated the\nperformance between LSS Transformer and the state-of-the-art Nvidia sequence\nparallelism on a Wikipedia enwik8 dataset.

    "summary": "In autonomous driving, accurate 3D lane detection using monocular cameras is\nimportant for downstream tasks. Recent CNN and Transformer approaches usually\napply a two-stage model design. The first stage transforms the image feature\nfrom a front image into a bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Subsequently, a\nsub-network processes the BEV feature to generate the 3D detection results.\nHowever, these approaches heavily rely on a challenging image feature\ntransformation module from a perspective view to a BEV representation. In our\nwork, we present CurveFormer++, a single-stage Transformer-based method that\ndoes not require the view transform module and directly infers 3D lane results\nfrom the perspective image features. Specifically, our approach models the 3D\nlane detection task as a curve propagation problem, where each lane is\nrepresented by a curve query with a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. By\nemploying a Transformer decoder, the model can iteratively refine the 3D lane\nresults. A curve cross-attention module is introduced to calculate similarities\nbetween image features and curve queries. To handle varying lane lengths, we\nemploy context sampling and anchor point restriction techniques to compute more\nrelevant image features. Furthermore, we apply a temporal fusion module that\nincorporates selected informative sparse curve queries and their corresponding\nanchor point sets to leverage historical information. In the experiments, we\nevaluate our approach on two publicly real-world datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our method provides outstanding performance compared with both\nCNN and Transformer based methods. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze\nthe impact of each component.",

Incorporating Transformers with SNNs has shown promise for accuracy.\nHowever, they struggle to learn high-frequency patterns, such as moving edges\nand pixel-level brightness changes, because they rely on the global\nself-attention mechanism. Learning these high-frequency representations is\nchallenging but essential for SNN-based event-driven vision. To address this\nissue, we propose the Spiking Wavelet Transformer (SWformer), an attention-free\narchitecture that effectively learns comprehensive spatial-frequency features\nin a spike-driven manner by leveraging the sparse wavelet transform. The\ncritical component is a Frequency-Aware Token Mixer (FATM) with three branches:\n1) spiking wavelet learner for spatial-frequency domain learning, 2)\nconvolution-based learner for spatial feature extraction, and 3) spiking\npointwise convolution for cross-channel information aggregation - with negative\nspike dynamics incorporated in 1) to enhance frequency representation.

To address these\nissues, we propose an efficient point TransFormer with Dynamic Token\nAggregating (DTA-Former) for point cloud representation and processing.\nFirstly, we propose an efficient Learnable Token Sparsification (LTS) block,\nwhich considers both local and global semantic information for the adaptive\nselection of key tokens.

After that, a dual-attention\nTransformer-based Global Feature Enhancement (GFE) block is used to improve the\nrepresentation capability of the model. Equipped with LTS, DTA, and GFE blocks,\nDTA-Former achieves excellent classification results via hierarchical feature\nlearning. Lastly, a novel Iterative Token Reconstruction (ITR) block is\nintroduced for dense prediction whereby the semantic features of tokens and\ntheir semantic relationships are gradually optimized during iterative\nreconstruction.

Currently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nbased models are the most popular methods applied to depth completion tasks.\nHowever, despite the excellent high-end performance, they suffer from a limited\nrepresentation area. To overcome the drawbacks of CNNs, a more effective and\npowerful method has been presented: the Transformer, which is an adaptive\nself-attention setting sequence-to-sequence model. While the standard\nTransformer quadratically increases the computational cost from the key-query\ndot-product of input resolution which improperly employs depth completion\ntasks. In this work, we propose a different window-based Transformer\narchitecture for depth completion tasks named Sparse-to-Dense Transformer\n(SDformer). The network consists of an input module for the depth map and RGB\nimage features extraction and concatenation, a U-shaped encoder-decoder\nTransformer for extracting deep features, and a refinement module.\nSpecifically, we first concatenate the depth map features with the RGB image\nfeatures through the input model. Then, instead of calculating self-attention\nwith the whole feature maps, we apply different window sizes to extract the\nlong-range depth dependencies. Finally, we refine the predicted features from\nthe input module and the U-shaped encoder-decoder Transformer module to get the\nenriching depth features and employ a convolution layer to obtain the dense\ndepth map.

    "summary": "Transformers have become the backbone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs);\nhowever, their inference overhead grows linearly with the sequence length,\nposing challenges for modeling long sequences. In light of this, Mamba has\nattracted attention for maintaining a constant inference size, with empirical\nevidence demonstrating that it can match Transformer performance in sequence\nmodeling while significantly reducing computational costs. However, an open\nquestion remains: can Mamba always bring savings while achieving performance\ncomparable to Transformers? In this paper, we focus on analyzing the expressive\nability of Mamba to perform our defined COPY operation and Chain of Thought\n(CoT) reasoning. First, inspired by the connection between Mamba and linear\nattention, we show that constant-sized Mamba may struggle to perform COPY\noperations while Transformers can handle them more easily. However, when the\nsize of Mamba grows linearly with the input sequence length, it can accurately\nperform COPY, but in this case, Mamba no longer provides overhead savings.\nBased on this observation, we further analyze Mamba's ability to tackle CoT\ntasks, which can be described by the Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our\nfindings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba\nis still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient\nTransformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as\nlocality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy\nand CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers\nin learning these tasks.",

    "summary": "Compression has been a critical lens to understand the success of\nTransformers. In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a\ncriterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often\nremains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression\nand to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of\nthe target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is\ntypically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In\nthis work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We\nfind that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression:\nbeyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning\nlower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the\nmodel size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly\naligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its\ninformation content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical\nrole in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational\nredundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within\ntheir parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through\ndynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers,\nparticularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for\nthis, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing\nattention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of\nactive neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger\nmodels strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work\ncontributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy\nand dynamic sparsity.",

Previous works exploit user-item\nrelationships of one-hop neighbors in the user-item interaction graph to\nimprove the quality of representation. Recently, the research of Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) for recommendation considers the implicit collaborative\ninformation of multi-hop neighbors to enrich the representation. However, most\nworks of GNN for recommendation systems do not consider the relational\ninformation which implies the expression differences of different neighbors in\nthe neighborhood explicitly. The influence of each neighboring item to the\nrepresentation of the user's preference can be represented by the correlation\nbetween the item and neighboring items of the user. Symmetrically, for a given\nitem, the correlation between one neighboring user and neighboring users can\nreflect the strength of signal about the item's characteristic. To modeling the\nimplicit correlations of neighbors in graph embedding aggregating, we propose a\nNeighbor-Aware Graph Attention Network for recommendation task, termed\nNGAT4Rec. It employs a novel neighbor-aware graph attention layer that assigns\ndifferent neighbor-aware attention coefficients to different neighbors of a\ngiven node by computing the attention among these neighbors pairwisely.

    "summary": "Recent Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods put emphasis on generating a\ndiscriminative embedding features to precisely measure the similarity between\nsupport and query sets. Current CNN-based cross-attention approaches generate\ndiscriminative representations via enhancing the mutually semantic similar\nregions of support and query pairs. However, it suffers from two problems: CNN\nstructure produces inaccurate attention map based on local features, and\nmutually similar backgrounds cause distraction. To alleviate these problems, we\ndesign a novel SpatialFormer structure to generate more accurate attention\nregions based on global features. Different from the traditional Transformer\nmodeling intrinsic instance-level similarity which causes accuracy degradation\nin FSL, our SpatialFormer explores the semantic-level similarity between pair\ninputs to boost the performance. Then we derive two specific attention modules,\nnamed SpatialFormer Semantic Attention (SFSA) and SpatialFormer Target\nAttention (SFTA), to enhance the target object regions while reduce the\nbackground distraction. Particularly, SFSA highlights the regions with same\nsemantic information between pair features, and SFTA finds potential foreground\nobject regions of novel feature that are similar to base categories.

    "summary": "Self-attention has become a defacto choice for capturing global context in\nvarious vision applications. However, its quadratic computational complexity\nwith respect to image resolution limits its use in real-time applications,\nespecially for deployment on resource-constrained mobile devices. Although\nhybrid approaches have been proposed to combine the advantages of convolutions\nand self-attention for a better speed-accuracy trade-off, the expensive matrix\nmultiplication operations in self-attention remain a bottleneck. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel efficient additive attention mechanism that effectively\nreplaces the quadratic matrix multiplication operations with linear\nelement-wise multiplications. Our design shows that the key-value interaction\ncan be replaced with a linear layer without sacrificing any accuracy. Unlike\nprevious state-of-the-art methods, our efficient formulation of self-attention\nenables its usage at all stages of the network. Using our proposed efficient\nadditive attention, we build a series of models called \"SwiftFormer\" which\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and mobile\ninference speed. Our small variant achieves 78.5% top-1 ImageNet-1K accuracy\nwith only 0.8 ms latency on iPhone 14, which is more accurate and 2x faster\ncompared to MobileViT-v2.

We\nqualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process\n$\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, the subset of $\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k}$ with depth bounded by\n$D$, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of\nnatural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with\n$D+1$ layers and $O(\\log k)$ memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes\n$\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$, and a soft-attention network with two layers and\n$O(\\log k)$ memory size that generates $\\mathsf{Dyck}_{k, D}$.

In this study,\nwe show that GAP is a special case of a discrete cosine transform (DCT) on\ntime-frequency domain mathematically using only the lowest frequency component\nin frequency decomposition. To strengthen the speaker information extraction\nability, we propose to utilize multi-frequency information and design two novel\nand effective attention modules, called Single-Frequency Single-Channel (SFSC)\nattention module and Multi-Frequency Single-Channel (MFSC) attention module.\nThe proposed attention modules can effectively capture more speaker information\nfrom multiple frequency components on the basis of DCT.

A VCR model generally aims\nat answering a textual question regarding an image, followed by the rationale\nprediction for the preceding answering process.

They, therefore, ignore the pivotal\nrelationship between the two processes, leading to sub-optimal model\nperformance. This paper presents a novel visual attention alignment method to\nefficaciously handle these two processes in a unified framework.

We apply this method to both\nconventional attention and the recent Transformer models and carry out\nextensive experiments on the VCR benchmark dataset.

    "summary": "Designing an effective channel attention mechanism implores one to find a\nlossy-compression method allowing for optimal feature representation. Despite\nrecent progress in the area, it remains an open problem. FcaNet, the current\nstate-of-the-art channel attention mechanism, attempted to find such an\ninformation-rich compression using Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCTs). One\ndrawback of FcaNet is that there is no natural choice of the DCT frequencies.\nTo circumvent this issue, FcaNet experimented on ImageNet to find optimal\nfrequencies. We hypothesize that the choice of frequency plays only a\nsupporting role and the primary driving force for the effectiveness of their\nattention filters is the orthogonality of the DCT kernels. To test this\nhypothesis, we construct an attention mechanism using randomly initialized\northogonal filters. Integrating this mechanism into ResNet, we create OrthoNet.\nWe compare OrthoNet to FcaNet (and other attention mechanisms) on Birds,\nMS-COCO, and Places356 and show superior performance. On the ImageNet dataset,\nour method competes with or surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Our results\nimply that an optimal choice of filter is elusive and generalization can be\nachieved with a sufficiently large number of orthogonal filters.

Weakly-supervised methods normally employ less\nexpensive forms of supervision, among which scribbles started to gain\npopularity lately thanks to its flexibility. However, due to lack of shape and\nboundary information, it is extremely challenging to train a deep network on\nscribbles that generalizes on unlabeled pixels. In this paper, we present a\nstraightforward yet effective scribble supervised learning framework. Inspired\nby recent advances of transformer based segmentation, we create a pluggable\nspatial self-attention module which could be attached on top of any internal\nfeature layers of arbitrary fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone. The\nmodule infuses global interaction while keeping the efficiency of convolutions.\nDescended from this module, we construct a similarity metric based on\nnormalized and symmetrized attention. This attentive similarity leads to a\nnovel regularization loss that imposes consistency between segmentation\nprediction and visual affinity. This attentive similarity loss optimizes the\nalignment of FCN encoders, attention mapping and model prediction. Ultimately,\nthe proposed FCN+Attention architecture can be trained end-to-end guided by a\ncombination of three learning objectives: partial segmentation loss, a\ncustomized masked conditional random fields and the proposed attentive\nsimilarity loss.

The transformer-based approaches address this limitation by\nleveraging the global receptive field, but they often face challenges in\ncapturing local information required for pixel-precise segmentation. In this\nwork, we introduce DwinFormer, a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture for\nmedical image segmentation comprising a directional window (Dwin) attention and\nglobal self-attention (GSA) for feature encoding. The focus of our design is\nthe introduction of Dwin block within DwinFormer that effectively captures\nlocal and global information along the horizontal, vertical, and depthwise\ndirections of the input feature map by separately performing attention in each\nof these directional volumes. To this end, our Dwin block introduces a nested\nDwin attention (NDA) that progressively increases the receptive field in\nhorizontal, vertical, and depthwise directions and a convolutional Dwin\nattention (CDA) that captures local contextual information for the attention\ncomputation. While the proposed Dwin block captures local and global\ndependencies at the first two high-resolution stages of DwinFormer, the GSA\nblock encodes global dependencies at the last two lower-resolution stages.\nExperiments over the challenging 3D Synapse Multi-organ dataset and Cell HMS\ndataset demonstrate the benefits of our DwinFormer over the state-of-the-art\napproaches.

    "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently achieved significant success in the\ngraph domain by effectively capturing both long-range dependencies and graph\ninductive biases. However, these methods face two primary challenges: (1)\nmulti-view chaos, which results from coupling multi-view information\n(positional, structural, attribute), thereby impeding flexible usage and the\ninterpretability of the propagation process. (2) local-global chaos, which\narises from coupling local message passing with global attention, leading to\nissues of overfitting and over-globalizing. To address these challenges, we\npropose a high-level decoupled perspective of GTs, breaking them down into\nthree components and two interaction levels: positional attention, structural\nattention, and attribute attention, alongside local and global interaction.\nBased on this decoupled perspective, we design a decoupled graph triple\nattention network named DeGTA, which separately computes multi-view attentions\nand adaptively integrates multi-view local and global information. This\napproach offers three key advantages: enhanced interpretability, flexible\ndesign, and adaptive integration of local and global information. Through\nextensive experiments, DeGTA achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nvarious datasets and tasks, including node classification and graph\nclassification. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that decoupling is\nessential for improving performance and enhancing interpretability.

    "summary": "This study introduces a new dense pest counting problem to predict densely\ndistributed pests captured by digital traps. Unlike traditional detection-based\ncounting models for sparsely distributed objects, trap-based pest counting must\ndeal with dense pest distributions that pose challenges such as severe\nocclusion, wide pose variation, and similar appearances in colors and textures.\nTo address these problems, it is essential to incorporate the local attention\nmechanism, which identifies locally important and unimportant areas to learn\nlocally grouped features, thereby enhancing discriminative performance.\nAccordingly, this study presents a novel design that integrates locally grouped\nand scale-guided attention into a multiscale CenterNet framework. To group\nlocal features with similar attributes, a straightforward method is introduced\nusing the heatmap predicted by the first hourglass containing pest centroid\ninformation, which eliminates the need for complex clustering models. To\nenhance attentiveness, the pixel attention module transforms the heatmap into a\nlearnable map. Subsequently, scale-guided attention is deployed to make the\nobject and background features more discriminative, achieving multiscale\nfeature fusion. Through experiments, the proposed model is verified to enhance\nobject features based on local grouping and discriminative feature attention\nlearning. Additionally, the proposed model is highly effective in overcoming\nocclusion and pose variation problems, making it more suitable for dense pest\ncounting. In particular, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models\nby a large margin, with a remarkable contribution to dense pest counting.",

Our findings suggest that imposing additional regularization\non class-patch attention is necessary. To this end, we first view the attention\nas a novel directed graph and propose the Graph Category Representation module\nto implicitly regularize the interaction among class-patch entities.

    "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly\nexperiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds\nat atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing\nto enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more\ntraditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range\ninteractions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention\nmechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global\nattention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to\ninconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce\nthe first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -\nthat enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN\nwith chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global\nattention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven\ndiverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and\nclassification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message\npassing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study\nshows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused\nlocal-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by\nlong-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute\ntrade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these\nresults establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in\natomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model\ndevelopment.",

    "summary": "Transformers have become the dominant model in natural language processing,\nowing to their ability to pretrain on massive amounts of data, then transfer to\nsmaller, more specific tasks via fine-tuning. The Vision Transformer was the\nfirst major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as\ninput, demonstrating that as compared to convolutional networks,\ntransformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark\nclassification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention\noperator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex\ntasks such as detection or segmentation, maintaining a high input resolution is\ncrucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in\ntheir output. This naturally raises the question of whether or not\ntransformer-based architectures such as the Vision Transformer are capable of\nperforming tasks other than classification. In this paper, we determine that\nVision Transformers can be used as a backbone by a common detection task head\nto produce competitive COCO results. The model that we propose, ViT-FRCNN,\ndemonstrates several known properties associated with transformers, including\nlarge pretraining capacity and fast fine-tuning performance. We also\ninvestigate improvements over a standard detection backbone, including superior\nperformance on out-of-domain images, better performance on large objects, and a\nlessened reliance on non-maximum suppression.

Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where\nthe idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random\ntransformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random\nsamples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial\nimages at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive\nthat the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in\nwhich how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of\nsoftmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random\ntransformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax\ndistribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of\nsoftmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the\nadversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes\nof the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean\nimages. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing\ntransformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution\nclassifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax\noutputs of transformed images.

However, most existing methods are based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fail to build long-range\ndependencies and global context connections due to the limitation of receptive\nfield in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in\nmodeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended\nconsiderable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based\nU-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores\nthe pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate\nthese problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework\ncalled Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first\nattempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin\nTransformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture\nto enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike\nmany prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts\ndual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse\nand fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the\ncore component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive\nFusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies\nbetween features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.\nFurthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to\nfurther explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling\nprocess.

A key idea of efficient\nimplementation is to discard the masked image patches (or tokens) throughout\nthe target network (encoder), which requires the encoder to be a plain vision\ntransformer (e.g., ViT), albeit hierarchical vision transformers (e.g., Swin\nTransformer) have potentially better properties in formulating vision inputs.\nIn this paper, we offer a new design of hierarchical vision transformers named\nHiViT (short for Hierarchical ViT) that enjoys both high efficiency and good\nperformance in MIM. The key is to remove the unnecessary \"local inter-unit\noperations\", deriving structurally simple hierarchical vision transformers in\nwhich mask-units can be serialized like plain vision transformers. For this\npurpose, we start with Swin Transformer and (i) set the masking unit size to be\nthe token size in the main stage of Swin Transformer, (ii) switch off\ninter-unit self-attentions before the main stage, and (iii) eliminate all\noperations after the main stage. Empirical studies demonstrate the advantageous\nperformance of HiViT in terms of fully-supervised, self-supervised, and\ntransfer learning. In particular, in running MAE on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B\nreports a +0.6% accuracy gain over ViT-B and a 1.9$\\times$ speed-up over\nSwin-B, and the performance gain generalizes to downstream tasks of detection\nand segmentation.

    "summary": "In Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRSs), Transformer models have\ndemonstrated remarkable performance but face computational and memory cost\nchallenges, especially when modeling long-term user behavior sequences. Due to\nits quadratic complexity, the dot-product attention mechanism in Transformers\nbecomes expensive for processing long sequences. By approximating the\ndot-product attention using elaborate mapping functions, linear attention\nprovides a more efficient option with linear complexity. However, existing\nlinear attention methods face three limitations: 1) they often use learnable\nposition encodings, which incur extra computational costs in long-term sequence\nscenarios, 2) they may not sufficiently account for user's fine-grained local\npreferences (short-lived burst of interest), and 3) they try to capture some\ntemporary activities, but often confuse these with stable and long-term\ninterests. This can result in unclear or less effective recommendations. To\nremedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model\nwith Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first\npropose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to efficiently model\nlong-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary\nposition encodings. Then, we introduce a local short operation to add the local\npreferences of interactions and show the theoretical insight. We further\nintroduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model tell\nif a user behavior shows a short-term, local interest or a real change in their\nlong-term tastes.

    "summary": "Recent trackers adopt the Transformer to combine or replace the widely used\nResNet as their new backbone network. Although their trackers work well in\nregular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence\nto better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial\nprior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,\nit may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve\nor even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this\npaper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the\nGaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)\nsimultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced\nby multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed\ninto a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct\nsignal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled\nand combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will\nbe protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the\nSpatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a\nnovel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based\nSwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head\ncross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and\ntemplate features. The output will be fed into the tracking head for target\nlocalization. Extensive experiments on both short-term and long-term tracking\nbenchmarks all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

Recently, there have been some\ninitial attempts to apply Transformers to federated learning. However, the\nimpacts of federated learning algorithms on self-attention have not yet been\nstudied. This paper investigates this relationship and reveals that federated\naveraging algorithms actually have a negative impact on self-attention where\nthere is data heterogeneity.

    "summary": "Recently, Transformer-based methods for point cloud learning have achieved\ngood results on various point cloud learning benchmarks. However, since the\nattention mechanism needs to generate three feature vectors of query, key, and\nvalue to calculate attention features, most of the existing Transformer-based\npoint cloud learning methods usually consume a large amount of computational\ntime and memory resources when calculating global attention. To address this\nproblem, we propose a Voxel-Transformer-Point (VTP) Block for extracting local\nand global features of point clouds. VTP combines the advantages of\nvoxel-based, point-based and Transformer-based methods, which consists of\nVoxel-Based Branch (V branch), Point-Based Transformer Branch (PT branch) and\nPoint-Based Branch (P branch). The V branch extracts the coarse-grained\nfeatures of the point cloud through low voxel resolution; the PT branch obtains\nthe fine-grained features of the point cloud by calculating the self-attention\nin the local neighborhood and the inter-neighborhood cross-attention; the P\nbranch uses a simplified MLP network to generate the global location\ninformation of the point cloud. In addition, to enrich the local features of\npoint clouds at different scales, we set the voxel scale in the V branch and\nthe neighborhood sphere scale in the PT branch to one large and one small\n(large voxel scale \\& small neighborhood sphere scale or small voxel scale \\&\nlarge neighborhood sphere scale). Finally, we use VTP as the feature extraction\nnetwork to construct a VTPNet for point cloud learning, and performs shape\nclassification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks on the\nModelNet40, ShapeNet Part, and S3DIS datasets. The experimental results\nindicate that VTPNet has good performance in 3D point cloud learning.",

This\ndesign facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of\nthe global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across\ndifferent types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used\ndata augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local\nfeatures in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a\ntransformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to\npinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.\nTests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed\nthat ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,\nreliability, and flexibility.

Yes, it LARNNs. The\nLARNN uses attention on its past cell state values for a limited window size\n$k$. The formulas are also derived from the Batch Normalized LSTM (BN-LSTM)\ncell and the Transformer Network for its Multi-Head Attention Mechanism. The\nMulti-Head Attention Mechanism is used inside the cell such that it can query\nits own $k$ past values with the attention window. This has the effect of\naugmenting the rank of the tensor with the attention mechanism, such that the\ncell can perform complex queries to question its previous inner memories, which\nshould augment the long short-term effect of the memory. With a clever trick,\nthe LARNN cell with attention can be easily used inside a loop on the cell\nstate, just like how any other Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cell can be\nlooped linearly through time series. This is due to the fact that its state,\nwhich is looped upon throughout time steps within time series, stores the inner\nstates in a \"first in, first out\" queue which contains the $k$ most recent\nstates and on which it is easily possible to add static positional encoding\nwhen the queue is represented as a tensor. This neural architecture yields\nbetter results than the vanilla LSTM cells. It can obtain results of 91.92% for\nthe test accuracy, compared to the previously attained 91.65% using vanilla\nLSTM cells. Note that this is not to compare to other research, where up to\n93.35% is obtained, but costly using 18 LSTM cells rather than with 2 to 3\ncells as analyzed here. Finally, an interesting discovery is made, such that\nadding activation within the multi-head attention mechanism's linear layers can\nyield better results in the context researched hereto.",

Running times of these\nalgorithms depend exponentially on $B$ and thus they do not lead to even a\npolynomial-time algorithm outside the specific range of $B$.\n  This naturally leads to the question: when can Attention be computed\nefficiently without strong assumptions on temperature? Are there fast attention\nalgorithms that scale polylogarithmically with entry size $B$? In this work, we\nresolve this question and characterize when fast Attention for arbitrary\ntemperatures is possible.

Furthermore, we show that any substantial improvement on our\nalgorithm is unlikely. In particular, we show that even when $d =\n2^{\\Theta(\\log^* n)}$, Attention requires $n^{2 - o(1)}$ time under\n$\\mathsf{SETH}$.\n  Finally, in the regime where $d = \\mathrm{poly}(n)$, we show that the\nstandard algorithm is optimal under popular fine-grained complexity\nassumptions.",

    "summary": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have long been the dominant architecture in\nsequence-to-sequence learning. RNNs, however, are inherently sequential models\nthat do not allow parallelization of their computations.

In this paper, we propose\nthe SepFormer, a novel RNN-free Transformer-based neural network for speech\nseparation. The SepFormer learns short and long-term dependencies with a\nmulti-scale approach that employs transformers. The proposed model achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the standard WSJ0-2/3mix datasets. It\nreaches an SI-SNRi of 22.3 dB on WSJ0-2mix and an SI-SNRi of 19.5 dB on\nWSJ0-3mix. The SepFormer inherits the parallelization advantages of\nTransformers and achieves a competitive performance even when downsampling the\nencoded representation by a factor of 8. It is thus significantly faster and it\nis less memory-demanding than the latest speech separation systems with\ncomparable performance.",

    "summary": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) denoising is an important problem in CT\nresearch. Compared to the normal dose CT (NDCT), LDCT images are subjected to\nsevere noise and artifacts. Recently in many studies, vision transformers have\nshown superior feature representation ability over convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). However, unlike CNNs, the potential of vision transformers in\nLDCT denoising was little explored so far. To fill this gap, we propose a\nConvolution-free Token2Token Dilated Vision Transformer for low-dose CT\ndenoising. The CTformer uses a more powerful token rearrangement to encompass\nlocal contextual information and thus avoids convolution. It also dilates and\nshifts feature maps to capture longer-range interaction. We interpret the\nCTformer by statically inspecting patterns of its internal attention maps and\ndynamically tracing the hierarchical attention flow with an explanatory graph.\nFurthermore, an overlapped inference mechanism is introduced to effectively\neliminate the boundary artifacts that are common for encoder-decoder-based\ndenoising models. Experimental results on Mayo LDCT dataset suggest that the\nCTformer outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising methods with a low\ncomputation overhead.",

    "summary": "After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer\narchitectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework\nallows us to identify size redundancies of $25\\%-50\\%$ in leading NLP models\nsuch as ALBERT and T5.",

However, many existing models fail to fully\nconsider the geometric information of molecular structures, resulting in less\nintuitive representations. Moreover, the widely used message-passing mechanism\nis limited to provide the interpretation of experimental results from a\nchemical perspective. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nTransformer-based framework for molecular representation learning, named the\nGeometry-aware Transformer (GeoT). GeoT learns molecular graph structures\nthrough attention-based mechanisms specifically designed to offer reliable\ninterpretability, as well as molecular property prediction. Consequently, GeoT\ncan generate attention maps of interatomic relationships associated with\ntraining objectives. In addition, GeoT demonstrates comparable performance to\nMPNN-based models while achieving reduced computational complexity. Our\ncomprehensive experiments, including an empirical simulation, reveal that GeoT\neffectively learns the chemical insights into molecular structures, bridging\nthe gap between artificial intelligence and molecular sciences.",

    "summary": "Video prediction is a challenging computer vision task that has a wide range\nof applications. In this work, we present a new family of Transformer-based\nmodels for video prediction. Firstly, an efficient local spatial-temporal\nseparation attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the complexity of standard\nTransformers. Then, a full autoregressive model, a partial autoregressive model\nand a non-autoregressive model are developed based on the new efficient\nTransformer. The partial autoregressive model has a similar performance with\nthe full autoregressive model but a faster inference speed. The\nnon-autoregressive model not only achieves a faster inference speed but also\nmitigates the quality degradation problem of the autoregressive counterparts,\nbut it requires additional parameters and loss function for learning. Given the\nsame attention mechanism, we conducted a comprehensive study to compare the\nproposed three video prediction variants. Experiments show that the proposed\nvideo prediction models are competitive with more complex state-of-the-art\nconvolutional-LSTM based models.

    "summary": "In vision-based action recognition, spatio-temporal features from different\nmodalities are used for recognizing activities. Temporal modeling is a long\nchallenge of action recognition. However, there are limited methods such as\npre-computed motion features, three-dimensional (3D) filters, and recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) for modeling motion information in deep-based approaches.\nRecently, transformers success in modeling long-range dependencies in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks has gotten great attention from other domains;\nincluding speech, image, and video, to rely entirely on self-attention without\nusing sequence-aligned RNNs or convolutions. Although the application of\ntransformers to action recognition is relatively new, the amount of research\nproposed on this topic within the last few years is astounding. This paper\nespecially reviews recent progress in deep learning methods for modeling\ntemporal variations. It focuses on action recognition methods that use\ntransformers for temporal modeling, discussing their main features, used\nmodalities, and identifying opportunities and challenges for future research.",

Moreover,\nto alleviate the fragility of our Transformer model against adversarial\nattacks, we attempt to learn smoother decision boundaries. To this end, we\naugment the shape information of an image in the high-level feature space by\npermuting the feature mean and variance within mini-batches.

Vision\nTransformers (ViT) adapt transformers for image recognition tasks. In order to\ndo this, the images are split into patches and used as tokens. One issue with\nViT is the lack of inductive bias toward image structures. Because ViT was\nadapted for image data from language modeling, the network does not explicitly\nhandle issues such as local translations, pixel information, and information\nloss in the structures and features shared by multiple patches. Conversely,\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) incorporate this information. Thus, in this\npaper, we propose the use of convolutional layers within ViT. Specifically, we\npropose a model called a Vision Conformer (ViC) which replaces the Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) in a ViT layer with a CNN. In addition, to use the CNN, we\nproposed to reconstruct the image data after the self-attention in a reverse\nembedding layer.

Then the proposed Key-Graph Attention is conducted\nunder the guidance of the Key-Graph only among selected nodes with linear\ncomputational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR\ntasks confirm the proposed KGT's state-of-the-art performance, showcasing\nadvancements both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "summary": "In the realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), two exciting research\ndirections have recently emerged: Subgraph GNNs and Graph Transformers. In this\npaper, we propose an architecture that integrates both approaches, dubbed\nSubgraphormer, which combines the enhanced expressive power, message-passing\nmechanisms, and aggregation schemes from Subgraph GNNs with attention and\npositional encodings, arguably the most important components in Graph\nTransformers. Our method is based on an intriguing new connection we reveal\nbetween Subgraph GNNs and product graphs, suggesting that Subgraph GNNs can be\nformulated as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) operating on a product of\nthe graph with itself. We use this formulation to design our architecture:\nfirst, we devise an attention mechanism based on the connectivity of the\nproduct graph. Following this, we propose a novel and efficient positional\nencoding scheme for Subgraph GNNs, which we derive as a positional encoding for\nthe product graph. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance\nimprovements over both Subgraph GNNs and Graph Transformers on a wide range of\ndatasets.",

    "summary": "An efficient customer service management system hinges on precise forecasting\nof service volume. In this scenario, where data non-stationarity is pronounced,\nsuccessful forecasting heavily relies on identifying and leveraging similar\nhistorical data rather than merely summarizing periodic patterns. Existing\nmodels based on RNN or Transformer architectures may struggle with this\nflexible and effective utilization. To tackle this challenge, we initially\ndeveloped the Time Series Knowledge Base (TSKB) with an advanced indexing\nsystem for efficient historical data retrieval. We also developed the Retrieval\nAugmented Cross-Attention (RACA) module, a variant of the cross-attention\nmechanism within Transformer's decoder layers, designed to be seamlessly\nintegrated into the vanilla Transformer architecture to assimilate key\nhistorical data segments. The synergy between TSKB and RACA forms the backbone\nof our Retrieval-Augmented Time Series Forecasting (RATSF) framework.

Motivated\nby the efficiency gains of hybrid models and the broad availability of\npretrained large transformer backbones, we explore transitioning transformer\nmodels into hybrid architectures for a more efficient generation.

This transformation can be performed without any training\nfor long-context understanding tasks or with minimal fine-tuning for o1-like\nlong reasoning generation tasks that require stronger reasoning capabilities.\nExperiments across diverse benchmarks and models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral,\nQwQ-STILL) demonstrate that, even when half of the layers are identified as\nlazy, LightTransfer achieves up to 2.17$\\times$ throughput improvement with\nminimal performance loss ($<1.5\\%$ on LongBench) and achieves 53.3\\% on math\nbenchmark AIME24 of advanced o1-like long reasoning model QwQ-STILL.",

    "title": "STEP: A Unified Spiking Transformer Evaluation Platform for Fair and\n  Reproducible Benchmarking",
    "summary": "Spiking Transformers have recently emerged as promising architectures for\ncombining the efficiency of spiking neural networks with the representational\npower of self-attention. However, the lack of standardized implementations,\nevaluation pipelines, and consistent design choices has hindered fair\ncomparison and principled analysis. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{STEP},\na unified benchmark framework for Spiking Transformers that supports a wide\nrange of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across\nstatic, event-based, and sequential datasets. STEP provides modular support for\ndiverse components such as spiking neurons, input encodings, surrogate\ngradients, and multiple backends (e.g., SpikingJelly, BrainCog). Using STEP, we\nreproduce and evaluate several representative models, and conduct systematic\nablation studies on attention design, neuron types, encoding schemes, and\ntemporal modeling capabilities. We also propose a unified analytical model for\nenergy estimation, accounting for spike sparsity, bitwidth, and memory access,\nand show that quantized ANNs may offer comparable or better energy efficiency.\nOur results suggest that current Spiking Transformers rely heavily on\nconvolutional frontends and lack strong temporal modeling, underscoring the\nneed for spike-native architectural innovations.

    "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by\nmodeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While\ngeneralizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by\nlearning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a\nlarge number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views,\nthese methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To\naddress this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature\nFusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable\nneural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with\nefficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it\nintegrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling\nhigh-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views.\nFurthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention\nweights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based\nneural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views,\nhighlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

First, we replace conventional\nUNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.\nConvolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance\nglobal context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,\nquerying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight\nattenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior\nbaselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.\nSecond, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric\ncoherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest\nneighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,\nprovides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM.

This leads to a principled and flexible\nframework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new\ndirections for architecture design, analysis, and control-based\ninterpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the\ngap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling,\nand contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of\ninterpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.",

    "title": "EcoFormer: Energy-Saving Attention with Linear Complexity",
    "summary": "Transformer is a transformative framework that models sequential data and has\nachieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, but with high\ncomputational and energy cost. To improve its efficiency, a popular choice is\nto compress the models via binarization which constrains the floating-point\nvalues into binary ones to save resource consumption owing to cheap bitwise\noperations significantly. However, existing binarization methods only aim at\nminimizing the information loss for the input distribution statistically, while\nignoring the pairwise similarity modeling at the core of the attention. To this\nend, we propose a new binarization paradigm customized to high-dimensional\nsoftmax attention via kernelized hashing, called EcoFormer, to map the original\nqueries and keys into low-dimensional binary codes in Hamming space. The\nkernelized hash functions are learned to match the ground-truth similarity\nrelations extracted from the attention map in a self-supervised way. Based on\nthe equivalence between the inner product of binary codes and the Hamming\ndistance as well as the associative property of matrix multiplication, we can\napproximate the attention in linear complexity by expressing it as a\ndot-product of binary codes. Moreover, the compact binary representations of\nqueries and keys enable us to replace most of the expensive multiply-accumulate\noperations in attention with simple accumulations to save considerable on-chip\nenergy footprint on edge devices. Extensive experiments on both vision and\nlanguage tasks show that EcoFormer consistently achieves comparable performance\nwith standard attentions while consuming much fewer resources. For example,\nbased on PVTv2-B0 and ImageNet-1K, Ecoformer achieves a 73% on-chip energy\nfootprint reduction with only a 0.33% performance drop compared to the standard\nattention.

    "summary": "In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing the context length is\ncrucial for improving comprehension and coherence in long-context, multi-modal,\nand retrieval-augmented language generation. While many recent transformer\nmodels attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they\nremain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although\nrecent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal,\ntheir real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from\nscratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel\napproach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time\ncomplexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity\nto $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the\nattention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have\nsimilar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this\nobservation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the\ntop-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically\nguaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In\naddition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we\nfurther optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which\nstores only $O(\\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding\nthroughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free\nnature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as\nmemory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal\ndegradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on\ncommodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously\ndeemed infeasible.",

The self-attention mechanism of the transformer enables\ntransformers to capture long-range dependencies in the images, which might be\ndesirable for accelerated MRI image reconstruction as the effect of\nundersampling is non-local in the image domain. Despite its computational\nefficiency, the window-based transformers suffer from restricted receptive\nfields as the dependencies are limited to within the scope of the image\nwindows. We propose a window-based transformer network that integrates dilated\nattention mechanism and convolution for accelerated MRI image reconstruction.\nThe proposed network consists of dilated and dense neighborhood attention\ntransformers to enhance the distant neighborhood pixel relationship and\nintroduce depth-wise convolutions within the transformer module to learn\nlow-level translation invariant features for accelerated MRI image\nreconstruction.

    "summary": "Attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a\nvariety of disciplines including natural languages. To deepen our understanding\nof their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using\nMarkov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on\nfirst-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently\ndevelop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram\nconditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to\nform an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a\nsurprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the\nunigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the\nground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model\nfirst-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel\nin practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior\nof single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a\nprincipled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our\nframework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer\ntransformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local\nminima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We\nprecisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence\nwith the empirical results.

    "summary": "Neural networks, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have achieved\nsignificant performance improvements on several retrieval benchmarks. When the\nitems being retrieved are documents, the time and memory cost of employing\nTransformers over a full sequence of document terms can be prohibitive. A\npopular strategy involves considering only the first n terms of the document.\nThis can, however, result in a biased system that under retrieves longer\ndocuments. In this work, we propose a local self-attention which considers a\nmoving window over the document terms and for each term attends only to other\nterms in the same window. This local attention incurs a fraction of the compute\nand memory cost of attention over the whole document. The windowed approach\nalso leads to more compact packing of padded documents in minibatches resulting\nin additional savings. We also employ a learned saturation function and a\ntwo-staged pooling strategy to identify relevant regions of the document. The\nTransformer-Kernel pooling model with these changes can efficiently elicit\nrelevance information from documents with thousands of tokens. We benchmark our\nproposed modifications on the document ranking task from the TREC 2019 Deep\nLearning track and observe significant improvements in retrieval quality as\nwell as increased retrieval of longer documents at moderate increase in compute\nand memory costs.",

Although substantial progresses have been made in\nautomatic FER in the past few decades, previous studies were mainly designed\nfor lab-controlled FER. Real-world occlusions, variant head poses and other\nissues definitely increase the difficulty of FER on account of these\ninformation-deficient regions and complex backgrounds. Different from previous\npure CNNs based methods, we argue that it is feasible and practical to\ntranslate facial images into sequences of visual words and perform expression\nrecognition from a global perspective. Therefore, we propose the Visual\nTransformers with Feature Fusion (VTFF) to tackle FER in the wild by two main\nsteps. First, we propose the attentional selective fusion (ASF) for leveraging\ntwo kinds of feature maps generated by two-branch CNNs. The ASF captures\ndiscriminative information by fusing multiple features with the global-local\nattention. The fused feature maps are then flattened and projected into\nsequences of visual words. Second, inspired by the success of Transformers in\nnatural language processing, we propose to model relationships between these\nvisual words with the global self-attention.

By\nincreasing the number of iterations within the message-passing of GNNs, the\nnodes' representations of the input graph align with each other and become\nindiscernible. Recently, it has been shown that increasing a model's complexity\nby integrating an attention mechanism yields more expressive architectures.\nThis is majorly contributed to steering the nodes' representations only towards\nnodes that are more informative than others. Transformer models in combination\nwith GNNs result in architectures including Graph Transformer Layers (GTL),\nwhere layers are entirely based on the attention operation. However, the\ncalculation of a node's representation is still restricted to the computational\nworking flow of a GNN. In our work, we relax the GNN architecture by means of\nimplementing a routing heuristic. Specifically, the nodes' representations are\nrouted to dedicated experts. Each expert calculates the representations\naccording to their respective GNN workflow. The definitions of distinguishable\nGNNs result from k-localized views starting from the central node. We call this\nprocedure Graph Shell Attention (SEA), where experts process different\nsubgraphs in a transformer-motivated fashion. Intuitively, by increasing the\nnumber of experts, the models gain in expressiveness such that a node's\nrepresentation is solely based on nodes that are located within the receptive\nfield of an expert.

    "title": "PAM: Pose Attention Module for Pose-Invariant Face Recognition",
    "summary": "Pose variation is one of the key challenges in face recognition. Conventional\ntechniques mainly focus on face frontalization or face augmentation in image\nspace. However, transforming face images in image space is not guaranteed to\npreserve the lossless identity features of the original image. Moreover, these\nmethods suffer from more computational costs and memory requirements due to the\nadditional models. We argue that it is more desirable to perform feature\ntransformation in hierarchical feature space rather than image space, which can\ntake advantage of different feature levels and benefit from joint learning with\nrepresentation learning. To this end, we propose a lightweight and\neasy-to-implement attention block, named Pose Attention Module (PAM), for\npose-invariant face recognition. Specifically, PAM performs frontal-profile\nfeature transformation in hierarchical feature space by learning residuals\nbetween pose variations with a soft gate mechanism. We validated the\neffectiveness of PAM block design through extensive ablation studies and\nverified the performance on several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,\nAgeDB-30, CPLFW, and CALFW. Experimental results show that our method not only\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods but also effectively reduces memory\nrequirements by more than 75 times. It is noteworthy that our method is not\nlimited to face recognition with large pose variations. By adjusting the soft\ngate mechanism of PAM to a specific coefficient, such semantic attention block\ncan easily extend to address other intra-class imbalance problems in face\nrecognition, including large variations in age, illumination, expression, etc.",

    "summary": "Human action recognition has recently become one of the popular research\ntopics in the computer vision community. Various 3D-CNN based methods have been\npresented to tackle both the spatial and temporal dimensions in the task of\nvideo action recognition with competitive results. However, these methods have\nsuffered some fundamental limitations such as lack of robustness and\ngeneralization, e.g., how does the temporal ordering of video frames affect the\nrecognition results? This work presents a novel end-to-end Transformer-based\nDirected Attention (DirecFormer) framework for robust action recognition. The\nmethod takes a simple but novel perspective of Transformer-based approach to\nunderstand the right order of sequence actions. Therefore, the contributions of\nthis work are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce the problem of ordered temporal\nlearning issues to the action recognition problem. Secondly, a new Directed\nAttention mechanism is introduced to understand and provide attentions to human\nactions in the right order. Thirdly, we introduce the conditional dependency in\naction sequence modeling that includes orders and classes. The proposed\napproach consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results compared\nwith the recent action recognition methods, on three standard large-scale\nbenchmarks, i.e. Jester, Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-V2.",

    "summary": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for visual\nperception tasks. The self-attention mechanism underpinning the strength of\nViTs has a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. This\nmotivates the development of approximating the self-attention at linear\ncomplexity. However, an in-depth analysis in this work reveals that existing\nmethods are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual\nrecognition. We identify that their limitations are rooted in the inheritance\nof softmax-based self-attention during approximations, that is, normalizing the\nscaled dot-product between token feature vectors using the softmax function. As\npreserving the softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization\nefforts. By this insight, a family of Softmax-Free Transformers (SOFT) are\nproposed. Specifically, a Gaussian kernel function is adopted to replace the\ndot-product similarity, enabling a full self-attention matrix to be\napproximated under low-rank matrix decomposition. For computational robustness,\nwe estimate the Moore-Penrose inverse using an iterative Newton-Raphson method\nin the forward process only, while calculating its theoretical gradients only\nonce in the backward process. To further expand applicability (e.g., dense\nprediction tasks), an efficient symmetric normalization technique is\nintroduced. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show that our\nSOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT\nvariants. With linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted by\nSOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.

To address these issues of RefSR, this paper proposes a deformable\nattention Transformer, namely DATSR, with multiple scales, each of which\nconsists of a texture feature encoder (TFE) module, a reference-based\ndeformable attention (RDA) module and a residual feature aggregation (RFA)\nmodule.

For comparison, the proposed architecture is\nevaluated against five different encoding schemes, including (1) VAE with only\nnormal data encoding, (2) VAE with only faulty data encoding, (3) VAE with both\nnormal and faulty data encodings, but without attention module in the\nclassifier, (4) siamese encoding, and (5) cross-vision transformer (CViT)\nencoding.

The transformer\narchitecture has been proposed as a possible candidate for effectively\nleveraging the high-resolution information.

    "summary": "Self-attention-based vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a highly\ncompetitive architecture in computer vision. Unlike convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs), ViTs are capable of global information sharing. With the\ndevelopment of various structures of ViTs, ViTs are increasingly advantageous\nfor many vision tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention\nrenders ViTs computationally intensive, and their lack of inductive biases of\nlocality and translation equivariance demands larger model sizes compared to\nCNNs to effectively learn visual features. In this paper, we propose a\nlight-weight and efficient vision transformer model called DualToken-ViT that\nleverages the advantages of CNNs and ViTs. DualToken-ViT effectively fuses the\ntoken with local information obtained by convolution-based structure and the\ntoken with global information obtained by self-attention-based structure to\nachieve an efficient attention structure. In addition, we use position-aware\nglobal tokens throughout all stages to enrich the global information, which\nfurther strengthening the effect of DualToken-ViT. Position-aware global tokens\nalso contain the position information of the image, which makes our model\nbetter for vision tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on image\nclassification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of DualToken-ViT. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, our models of\ndifferent scales achieve accuracies of 75.4% and 79.4% with only 0.5G and 1.0G\nFLOPs, respectively, and our model with 1.0G FLOPs outperforms LightViT-T using\nglobal tokens by 0.7%.",

Specifically, we first enhance a baseline\nconvolutional depth completion model by applying attention to 2D features in\nthe bottleneck and skip connections. This effectively improves the performance\nof this simple network and sets it on par with the latest, complex\ntransformer-based models. Leveraging the initial depths and features from this\nnetwork, we uplift the 2D features to form a 3D point cloud and construct a 3D\npoint transformer to process it, allowing the model to explicitly learn and\nexploit 3D geometric features. In addition, we propose normalization techniques\nto process the point cloud, which improves learning and leads to better\naccuracy than directly using point transformers off the shelf. Furthermore, we\nincorporate global attention on downsampled point cloud features, which enables\nlong-range context while still being computationally feasible. We evaluate our\nmethod, DeCoTR, on established depth completion benchmarks, including NYU Depth\nV2 and KITTI, showcasing that it sets new state-of-the-art performance.

    "summary": "Deep learning has shown remarkable success in remote sensing change detection\n(CD), aiming to identify semantic change regions between co-registered\nsatellite image pairs acquired at distinct time stamps. However, existing\nconvolutional neural network and transformer-based frameworks often struggle to\naccurately segment semantic change regions. Moreover, transformers-based\nmethods with standard self-attention suffer from quadratic computational\ncomplexity with respect to the image resolution, making them less practical for\nCD tasks with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose an\nefficient change detection framework, ELGC-Net, which leverages rich contextual\ninformation to precisely estimate change regions while reducing the model size.\nOur ELGC-Net comprises a Siamese encoder, fusion modules, and a decoder. The\nfocus of our design is the introduction of an Efficient Local-Global Context\nAggregator module within the encoder, capturing enhanced global context and\nlocal spatial information through a novel pooled-transpose (PT) attention and\ndepthwise convolution, respectively. The PT attention employs pooling\noperations for robust feature extraction and minimizes computational cost with\ntransposed attention.

The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference\nfails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs\nmaintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder.\nTherefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework\nutilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying\na complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the\nclassification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1)\nattention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission.\nAttention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the\nedge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches\ncritical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit\nonly the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication\nefficiency.

To address these challenges, we\npropose Low-Precision Approximate Attention with Head-wise Trainable Threshold\nfor Efficient Transformer (LATTE).

Most of them use self-attention along the channel\ndimension or within spatially fixed-range blocks to reduce computational load.\nHowever, such a compromise results in limitations in capturing long-range\nspatial features. Inspired by the observation that the weather-induced\ndegradation factors mainly cause similar occlusion and brightness, in this\nwork, we propose an efficient Histogram Transformer (Histoformer) for restoring\nimages affected by adverse weather. It is powered by a mechanism dubbed\nhistogram self-attention, which sorts and segments spatial features into\nintensity-based bins. Self-attention is then applied across bins or within each\nbin to selectively focus on spatial features of dynamic range and process\nsimilar degraded pixels of the long range together. To boost histogram\nself-attention, we present a dynamic-range convolution enabling conventional\nconvolution to conduct operation over similar pixels rather than neighbor\npixels. We also observe that the common pixel-wise losses neglect linear\nassociation and correlation between output and ground-truth. Thus, we propose\nto leverage the Pearson correlation coefficient as a loss function to enforce\nthe recovered pixels following the identical order as ground-truth.

Using a transformer-encoder block with easy-attention mechanism,\nthe model predicts the spatial probability density function of fluctuations not\ncaptured by the truncated POD modes. The methodology is demonstrated on the\nwake of the Windsor body at yaw angles of [2.5,5,7.5,10,12.5], with 7.5 as a\ntest case. Key coherent modes are identified by clustering them based on\ndominant frequency dynamics using Hotelling T2 on the spectral properties of\ntemporal coefficients. These coherent modes account for nearly 60% of the total\nenergy while comprising less than 10% of all modes.

Larger\nattention sizes always improve predictions for the training set, but the\ntransformer with an attention layer of size 256 overshoots the fluctuations\npredictions in the test set because they have lower intensity than in the\ntraining cases.

    "summary": "This study proposes a 3D semantic segmentation method for the spine based on\nthe improved SwinUNETR to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness. Aiming\nat the complex anatomical structure of spinal images, this paper introduces a\nmulti-scale fusion mechanism to enhance the feature extraction capability by\nusing information of different scales, thereby improving the recognition\naccuracy of the model for the target area. In addition, the introduction of the\nadaptive attention mechanism enables the model to dynamically adjust the\nattention to the key area, thereby optimizing the boundary segmentation effect.\nThe experimental results show that compared with 3D CNN, 3D U-Net, and 3D U-Net\n+ Transformer, the model of this study has achieved significant improvements in\nmIoU, mDice, and mAcc indicators, and has better segmentation performance. The\nablation experiment further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed improved\nmethod, proving that multi-scale fusion and adaptive attention mechanism have a\npositive effect on the segmentation task. Through the visualization analysis of\nthe inference results, the model can better restore the real anatomical\nstructure of the spinal image. Future research can further optimize the\nTransformer structure and expand the data scale to improve the generalization\nability of the model.

    "summary": "With the rise of social media and Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN),\ncheck-in data across platforms has become crucial for User Identity Linkage\n(UIL). These data not only reveal users' spatio-temporal information but also\nprovide insights into their behavior patterns and interests.

It employs a correlation attention mechanism to detect the\nspatio-temporal co-occurrence between user check-in sequences. Guided by\nattention weight maps, the model focuses on co-occurrence points while\nfiltering out noise, ultimately improving classification performance.\nExperimental results show that our model significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by 12.92%~17.76% and 5.80%~8.38% improvements in\nterms of Macro-F1 and Area Under Curve (AUC).",

    "summary": "State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to Transformers for\nlong sequences, but their fixed-size recurrent state limits capability on\nalgorithmic tasks, such as retrieving past context. In this work, we examine\nhow in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models\nand find that both rely on a similar Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism: a\nGather Head extracts relevant information pieces from context, which an\nAggregate Head integrates into a single representation. In both architectures,\nG&A concentrates in a few heads, forming critical bottlenecks even for simple\nretrieval. For example, we show that disabling a single Gather or Aggregate\nHead in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in\nMMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25% (random guessing). Moreover, this\nretrieval bottleneck can obscure limited knowledge demands of tasks as the\npruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&A heads yet fails on other\nknowledge benchmarks. The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs\ntypically underperform, such as GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue comprehension. We show\nthat SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother\nattention patterns instead of the sharp token transitions effective G&A\nrequires. Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads,\nrather than the entire language model. This suggests a unified explanation for\nTransformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths.\nWe find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with a few\nattention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention. Similarly,\nreplacing a single G&A head in a pretrained SSM with an attention variant\nboosts retrieval and benchmark scores.",

    "summary": "Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,\nare unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.\nHowever, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting\ndownstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization\nmethods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information\nand insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image\ndistortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery\nprovides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details\nand enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative\nadversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral\ninformation to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework\nemploys a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as\nthe generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention\ncomputation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral\nattention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and\nreducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a\nTransformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped\narchitecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale\nwavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency\ndual domain.

The attention-based\nmethods outperformed GradCAM on all metrics.\n  Conclusion: ViTs performed similarly to CNNs in CXR classification, and their\nattention-based saliency maps were more useful to radiologists and outperformed\nGradCAM.",

    "summary": "Long-term traffic prediction is highly challenging due to the complexity of\ntraffic systems and the constantly changing nature of many impacting factors.\nIn this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal factors, and propose a graph\nmulti-attention network (GMAN) to predict traffic conditions for time steps\nahead at different locations on a road network graph. GMAN adapts an\nencoder-decoder architecture, where both the encoder and the decoder consist of\nmultiple spatio-temporal attention blocks to model the impact of the\nspatio-temporal factors on traffic conditions. The encoder encodes the input\ntraffic features and the decoder predicts the output sequence. Between the\nencoder and the decoder, a transform attention layer is applied to convert the\nencoded traffic features to generate the sequence representations of future\ntime steps as the input of the decoder. The transform attention mechanism\nmodels the direct relationships between historical and future time steps that\nhelps to alleviate the error propagation problem among prediction time steps.\nExperimental results on two real-world traffic prediction tasks (i.e., traffic\nvolume prediction and traffic speed prediction) demonstrate the superiority of\nGMAN. In particular, in the 1 hour ahead prediction, GMAN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by up to 4% improvement in MAE measure.

    "summary": "Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful\ndeep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is\nthe quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due\nto their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a\nsparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We\nshow that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is\nTuring complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full\nattention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the\nbenefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the\nentire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse\nattention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously\npossible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle\nlonger context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks\nsuch as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel\napplications to genomics data.",

    "summary": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has recently demonstrated promise in computer vision\nproblems. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it is known that\nthe performance of ViT saturates quickly with depth increasing, due to the\nobserved attention collapse or patch uniformity. Despite a couple of empirical\nsolutions, a rigorous framework studying on this scalability issue remains\nelusive. In this paper, we first establish a rigorous theory framework to\nanalyze ViT features from the Fourier spectrum domain. We show that the\nself-attention mechanism inherently amounts to a low-pass filter, which\nindicates when ViT scales up its depth, excessive low-pass filtering will cause\nfeature maps to only preserve their Direct-Current (DC) component. We then\npropose two straightforward yet effective techniques to mitigate the\nundesirable low-pass limitation. The first technique, termed AttnScale,\ndecomposes a self-attention block into low-pass and high-pass components, then\nrescales and combines these two filters to produce an all-pass self-attention\nmatrix. The second technique, termed FeatScale, re-weights feature maps on\nseparate frequency bands to amplify the high-frequency signals. Both techniques\nare efficient and hyperparameter-free, while effectively overcoming relevant\nViT training artifacts such as attention collapse and patch uniformity. By\nseamlessly plugging in our techniques to multiple ViT variants, we demonstrate\nthat they consistently help ViTs benefit from deeper architectures, bringing up\nto 1.1% performance gains \"for free\" (e.g., with little parameter overhead).

To address these problems,\nthis paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants,\nMulti-scale Geometry-aware Transformer (MGT). MGT processes point cloud data\nwith multi-scale local and global geometric information in the following three\naspects. At first, the MGT divides point cloud data into patches with multiple\nscales. Secondly, a local feature extractor based on sphere mapping is proposed\nto explore the geometry inner each patch and generate a fixed-length\nrepresentation for each patch. Thirdly, the fixed-length representations are\nfed into a novel geodesic-based self-attention to capture the global\nnon-Euclidean geometry between patches.

Existing feature\nlifting approaches, such as Lift-Splat-based and 2D attention-based, either use\nestimated depth to get pseudo LiDAR features and then splat them to a 3D space,\nwhich is a one-pass operation without feature refinement, or ignore depth and\nlift features by 2D attention mechanisms, which achieve finer semantics while\nsuffering from a depth ambiguity problem. In contrast, our DFA3D-based method\nfirst leverages the estimated depth to expand each view's 2D feature map to 3D\nand then utilizes DFA3D to aggregate features from the expanded 3D feature\nmaps. With the help of DFA3D, the depth ambiguity problem can be effectively\nalleviated from the root, and the lifted features can be progressively refined\nlayer by layer, thanks to the Transformer-like architecture.

To address this issue, we propose ESSAformer, an\nESSA attention-embedded Transformer network for single-HSI-SR with an iterative\nrefining structure. Specifically, we first introduce a robust and\nspectral-friendly similarity metric, \\ie, the spectral correlation coefficient\nof the spectrum (SCC), to replace the original attention matrix and\nincorporates inductive biases into the model to facilitate training. Built upon\nit, we further utilize the kernelizable attention technique with theoretical\nsupport to form a novel efficient SCC-kernel-based self-attention (ESSA) and\nreduce attention computation to linear complexity. ESSA enlarges the receptive\nfield for features after upsampling without bringing much computation and\nallows the model to effectively utilize spatial-spectral information from\ndifferent scales, resulting in the generation of more natural high-resolution\nimages. Without the need for pretraining on large-scale datasets, our\nexperiments demonstrate ESSA's effectiveness in both visual quality and\nquantitative results.",

    "summary": "Recent stereo matching networks achieves dramatic performance by introducing\nepipolar line constraint to limit the matching range of dual-view. However, in\ncomplicated real-world scenarios, the feature information based on\nintra-epipolar line alone is too weak to facilitate stereo matching. In this\npaper, we present a simple but highly effective network called Alternated\nAttention U-shaped Transformer (AAUformer) to balance the impact of epipolar\nline in dual and single view respectively for excellent generalization\nperformance. Compared to other models, our model has several main designs: 1)\nto better liberate the local semantic features of the single-view at pixel\nlevel, we introduce window self-attention to break the limits of intra-row\nself-attention and completely replace the convolutional network for denser\nfeatures before cross-matching; 2) the multi-scale alternated attention\nbackbone network was designed to extract invariant features in order to\nachieves the coarse-to-fine matching process for hard-to-discriminate regions.\nWe performed a series of both comparative studies and ablation studies on\nseveral mainstream stereo matching datasets. The results demonstrate that our\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art on the Scene Flow dataset, and the fine-tuning\nperformance is competitive on the KITTI 2015 dataset.

    "summary": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has gained increasing attention in the computer\nvision community in recent years. However, the core component of ViT,\nSelf-Attention, lacks explicit spatial priors and bears a quadratic\ncomputational complexity, thereby constraining the applicability of ViT. To\nalleviate these issues, we draw inspiration from the recent Retentive Network\n(RetNet) in the field of NLP, and propose RMT, a strong vision backbone with\nexplicit spatial prior for general purposes. Specifically, we extend the\nRetNet's temporal decay mechanism to the spatial domain, and propose a spatial\ndecay matrix based on the Manhattan distance to introduce the explicit spatial\nprior to Self-Attention. Additionally, an attention decomposition form that\nadeptly adapts to explicit spatial prior is proposed, aiming to reduce the\ncomputational burden of modeling global information without disrupting the\nspatial decay matrix. Based on the spatial decay matrix and the attention\ndecomposition form, we can flexibly integrate explicit spatial prior into the\nvision backbone with linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRMT exhibits exceptional performance across various vision tasks. Specifically,\nwithout extra training data, RMT achieves **84.8%** and **86.1%** top-1 acc on\nImageNet-1k with **27M/4.5GFLOPs** and **96M/18.2GFLOPs**.

To address this limitation, inspired by\nthe Fourier neural operator (FNO), we introduce the HartleyMHA model which is\nrobust to training image resolution with efficient self-attention. FNO is a\ndeep learning framework for learning mappings between functions in partial\ndifferential equations, which has the appealing properties of zero-shot\nsuper-resolution and global receptive field.

Recently, end-to-end detectors have made significant strides by\nemploying attention mechanisms and refining a fixed number of queries through\nconsecutive decoder layers. However, existing end-to-end oriented object\ndetectors still face two primary challenges: 1) misalignment between positional\nqueries and keys, leading to inconsistency between classification and\nlocalization; and 2) the presence of a large number of similar queries, which\ncomplicates one-to-one label assignments and optimization. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an end-to-end oriented detector called the Rotated\nQuery Transformer, which integrates two key technologies: Rotated RoI Attention\n(RRoI Attention) and Selective Distinct Queries (SDQ). First, RRoI Attention\naligns positional queries and keys from oriented regions of interest through\ncross-attention. Second, SDQ collects queries from intermediate decoder layers\nand filters out similar ones to generate distinct queries, thereby facilitating\nthe optimization of one-to-one label assignments. Finally, extensive\nexperiments conducted on four remote sensing datasets and one scene text\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

    "summary": "Window-based transformers excel in large-scale point cloud understanding by\ncapturing context-aware representations with affordable attention computation\nin a more localized manner. However, the sparse nature of point clouds leads to\na significant variance in the number of voxels per window. Existing methods\ngroup the voxels in each window into fixed-length sequences through extensive\nsorting and padding operations, resulting in a non-negligible computational and\nmemory overhead. In this paper, we introduce ScatterFormer, which to the best\nof our knowledge, is the first to directly apply attention to voxels across\ndifferent windows as a single sequence. The key of ScatterFormer is a Scattered\nLinear Attention (SLA) module, which leverages the pre-computation of key-value\npairs in linear attention to enable parallel computation on the variable-length\nvoxel sequences divided by windows.

However, the inherent characteristics of the Image\nRestoration task are often overlooked in many works. They, instead, tend to\nfocus on the basic block design and stack numerous such blocks to the model,\nleading to parameters redundant and computations unnecessary. Thus, the\nefficiency of the image restoration is hindered. In this paper, we propose a\nLightweight Baseline network for Image Restoration called LIR to efficiently\nrestore the image and remove degradations. First of all, through an ingenious\nstructural design, LIR removes the degradations existing in the local and\nglobal residual connections that are ignored by modern networks.

    "title": "Gradformer: Graph Transformer with Exponential Decay",
    "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated their advantages across a wide\nrange of tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism in GTs overlooks the\ngraph's inductive biases, particularly biases related to structure, which are\ncrucial for the graph tasks. Although some methods utilize positional encoding\nand attention bias to model inductive biases, their effectiveness is still\nsuboptimal analytically. Therefore, this paper presents Gradformer, a method\ninnovatively integrating GT with the intrinsic inductive bias by applying an\nexponential decay mask to the attention matrix. Specifically, the values in the\ndecay mask matrix diminish exponentially, correlating with the decreasing node\nproximities within the graph structure. This design enables Gradformer to\nretain its ability to capture information from distant nodes while focusing on\nthe graph's local details. Furthermore, Gradformer introduces a learnable\nconstraint into the decay mask, allowing different attention heads to learn\ndistinct decay masks. Such an design diversifies the attention heads, enabling\na more effective assimilation of diverse structural information within the\ngraph. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that Gradformer\nconsistently outperforms the Graph Neural Network and GT baseline models in\nvarious graph classification and regression tasks. Additionally, Gradformer has\nproven to be an effective method for training deep GT models, maintaining or\neven enhancing accuracy compared to shallow models as the network deepens, in\ncontrast to the significant accuracy drop observed in other GT models.Codes are\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/LiuChuang0059/Gradformer}.",

    "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted for medical\nimage segmentation tasks, demonstrating promising performance. However, the\ninherent inductive biases in convolutional architectures limit their ability to\nmodel long-range dependencies and spatial correlations. While recent\ntransformer-based architectures address these limitations by leveraging\nself-attention mechanisms to encode long-range dependencies and learn\nexpressive representations, they often struggle to extract low-level features\nand are highly dependent on data availability. This motivated us for the\ndevelopment of GLIMS, a data-efficient attention-guided hybrid volumetric\nsegmentation network. GLIMS utilizes Dilated Feature Aggregator Convolutional\nBlocks (DACB) to capture local-global feature correlations efficiently.\nFurthermore, the incorporated Swin Transformer-based bottleneck bridges the\nlocal and global features to improve the robustness of the model. Additionally,\nGLIMS employs an attention-guided segmentation approach through Channel and\nSpatial-Wise Attention Blocks (CSAB) to localize expressive features for\nfine-grained border segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative results on\nglioblastoma and multi-organ CT segmentation tasks demonstrate GLIMS'\neffectiveness in terms of complexity and accuracy. GLIMS demonstrated\noutstanding performance on BraTS2021 and BTCV datasets, surpassing the\nperformance of Swin UNETR.

    "summary": "Specular highlight removal plays a pivotal role in multimedia applications,\nas it enhances the quality and interpretability of images and videos,\nultimately improving the performance of downstream tasks such as content-based\nretrieval, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite significant\nadvances in deep learning-based methods, current state-of-the-art approaches\noften rely on additional priors or supervision, limiting their practicality and\ngeneralization capability. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Hybrid Attention\nNetwork for Specular Highlight Removal (DHAN-SHR), an end-to-end network that\nintroduces novel hybrid attention mechanisms to effectively capture and process\ninformation across different scales and domains without relying on additional\npriors or supervision. DHAN-SHR consists of two key components: the Adaptive\nLocal Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Transformer (L-HD-DAT) and the Adaptive\nGlobal Dual Attention Transformer (G-DAT). The L-HD-DAT captures local\ninter-channel and inter-pixel dependencies while incorporating spectral domain\nfeatures, enabling the network to effectively model the complex interactions\nbetween specular highlights and the underlying surface properties. The G-DAT\nmodels global inter-channel relationships and long-distance pixel dependencies,\nallowing the network to propagate contextual information across the entire\nimage and generate more coherent and consistent highlight-free results. To\nevaluate the performance of DHAN-SHR and facilitate future research in this\narea, we compile a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising a diverse range of\nimages with varying levels of specular highlights.

However, CNNs exhibit a deficiency in global\nmodeling capability, hindering the representation to entire crack features.\nTransformers can capture long-range dependencies but suffer from high and\nquadratic complexity. Recently, Mamba has garnered extensive attention due to\nits linear spatial and computational complexity and its powerful global\nperception. This study explores the representation capabilities of Mamba to\ncrack features. Specifically, this paper uncovers the connection between Mamba\nand the attention mechanism, providing a profound insight, an attention\nperspective, into interpreting Mamba and devising a novel Mamba module\nfollowing the principles of attention blocks, namely CrackMamba.

    "title": "Active-Dormant Attention Heads: Mechanistically Demystifying\n  Extreme-Token Phenomena in LLMs",
    "summary": "Practitioners have consistently observed three puzzling phenomena in\ntransformer-based large language models (LLMs): attention sinks, value-state\ndrains, and residual-state peaks, collectively referred to as extreme-token\nphenomena. These phenomena are characterized by certain so-called \"sink tokens\"\nreceiving disproportionately high attention weights, exhibiting significantly\nsmaller value states, and having much larger residual-state norms than those of\nother tokens. These extreme tokens give rise to various challenges in LLM\ninference, quantization, and interpretability.\n  We elucidate the mechanisms behind extreme-token phenomena. First, we show\nthat these phenomena arise in very simple architectures -- transformers with\none to three layers -- trained on a toy model, the Bigram-Backcopy (BB) task.\nIn this setting, we identify an active-dormant mechanism, where attention heads\nbecome sinks for specific input domains while remaining non-sinks for others.\nOur theoretical analysis of the training dynamics reveals that these phenomena\nare driven by a mutual reinforcement mechanism. Building on these insights, we\npropose strategies to mitigate extreme-token phenomena during pretraining,\nincluding replacing softmax with ReLU and Adam with SGD. Next, we extend our\nanalysis to pretrained LLMs, including Llama and OLMo, showing that many\nattention heads exhibit a similar active-dormant mechanism as in the BB task,\nand that the mutual reinforcement mechanism also governs the emergence of\nextreme-token phenomena during LLM pretraining. Our results reveal that many of\nthe static and dynamic properties of extreme-token phenomena predicted by the\nBB task align with observations in pretrained LLMs.",

    "summary": "Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) has attracted growing interest at\nthe intersection of medical image understanding and natural language processing\nfor clinical applications. By interpreting medical images and providing precise\nanswers to relevant clinical inquiries, MedVQA has the potential to support\ndiagnostic decision-making and reduce workload across various fields like\nradiology. While recent approaches rely heavily on unified large pre-trained\nVisual-Language Models, research on more efficient fusion mechanisms remains\nrelatively limited in this domain. In this paper, we introduce a fusion model,\nOMniBAN, that integrates Orthogonality loss, Multi-head attention, and a\nBilinear Attention Network to achieve high computational efficiency as well as\nsolid performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments and demonstrate how\nbilinear attention fusion can approximate the performance of larger fusion\nmodels like cross-modal Transformer. Our results show that OMniBAN requires\nfewer parameters (approximately 2/3 of Transformer-based Co-Attention) and\nsubstantially lower FLOPs (approximately 1/4), while achieving comparable\noverall performance and even slight improvements on closed-ended questions on\ntwo key MedVQA benchmarks. This balance between efficiency and accuracy\nsuggests that OMniBAN could be a viable option for real-world medical image\nquestion answering, where computational resources are often constrained.",

    "summary": "In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior\nrate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods.\nRecent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational\nautoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite\ntheir significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor\nperformance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global\nfeatures along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution\nintegrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes\nimportant features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale\nwindow-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale\nwindow-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers\nand effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module\nand the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are\nflexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We\nevaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our\napproach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.

We further propose a self-supervised framework for\ntraining the transformer decoder from only a few 3D pointclouds without hand\ndemonstrations. Post-training, the attention field can be applied to novel\nscenes for semantics-aware dexterous grasping from one-shot demonstration.\nExperiments show that our method provides better optimization landscapes by\nencouraging the end-effector to focus on task-relevant scene regions, resulting\nin significant improvements in success rates on real robots compared with the\nfeature-field-based methods.",

    "summary": "The attention mechanism within the transformer architecture enables the model\nto weigh and combine tokens based on their relevance to the query. While\nself-attention has enjoyed major success, it notably treats all queries $q$ in\nthe same way by applying the mapping $V^\\top\\text{softmax}(Kq)$, where $V,K$\nare the value and key embeddings respectively. In this work, we argue that this\nuniform treatment hinders the ability to control contextual sparsity and\nrelevance. As a solution, we introduce the $\\textit{Selective Self-Attention}$\n(SSA) layer that augments the softmax nonlinearity with a principled\ntemperature scaling strategy. By controlling temperature, SSA adapts the\ncontextual sparsity of the attention map to the query embedding and its\nposition in the context window. Through theory and experiments, we demonstrate\nthat this alleviates attention dilution, aids the optimization process, and\nenhances the model's ability to control softmax spikiness of individual\nqueries. We also incorporate temperature scaling for value embeddings and show\nthat it boosts the model's ability to suppress irrelevant/noisy tokens.\nNotably, SSA is a lightweight method which introduces less than 0.5% new\nparameters through a weight-sharing strategy and can be fine-tuned on existing\nLLMs. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSA-equipped models\nachieve a noticeable and consistent accuracy improvement on language modeling\nbenchmarks.",

However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g.,\n128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to\nincrease.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive, decoder-only\nTransformers generate text one token at a time, where a token represents a\ndiscrete unit of text. As each newly produced token is appended to the partial\noutput sequence, the length grows and so does the memory and compute load, due\nto the expanding key-value caches, which store intermediate representations of\nall previously generated tokens in the multi-head attention (MHA) layer. As\nthis iterative process steadily increases memory and compute demands,\nlayer-based partitioning in resource-constrained edge environments often\nresults in memory overload or high inference latency. To address this and\nreduce inference latency, we propose a resource-aware Transformer architecture\npartitioning algorithm, where the partitioning decision is updated at regular\nintervals during token generation. The approach is myopic in that it is based\non instantaneous information about device resource availability and network\nlink bandwidths. When first executed, the algorithm places blocks on devices,\nand in later executions, it migrates these blocks among devices so that the sum\nof migration delay and inference delay remains low. Our approach partitions the\ndecoder at the attention head level, co-locating each attention head with its\nkey-value cache and allowing dynamic migrations whenever resources become\ntight. By allocating different attention heads to different devices, we exploit\nparallel execution of attention heads and thus achieve substantial reductions\nin inference delays. Our experiments show that in small-scale settings (3-5\ndevices), the proposed method achieves within 15 to 20 percent of an exact\noptimal solver's latency, while in larger-scale tests it achieves notable\nimprovements in inference speed and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art\nlayer-based partitioning approaches.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have achieved remarkable progress\nin text-driven visual generation. However, even state-of-the-art MM-DiT models\nlike FLUX struggle with achieving precise alignment between text prompts and\ngenerated content.

    "summary": "Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,\nincreasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle\nand time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial\nartifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.\nHowever, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal\nfeatures independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use\nseparate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine\nthem using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which\nlimits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we\npropose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse\nspatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows\ntemporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing\nthe model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as\nflickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization\nand deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across\ndiverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model\nusing the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both\nintra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.\nOur model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an\naccuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations.

    "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,\ndemonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

    "summary": "The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such\nas Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational\nprinciple: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how\ninformation flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this\nperspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a\nsingle-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token\nsimilarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise\nrelationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie\nin how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention\nwithin the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several\nstrands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical\nfoundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.",

Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic\nintensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long\nmotivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.\n  This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent\nAttention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of\nspecialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the\narithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that\nof MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern\naccelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of\naccelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match\nthat of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.\n  These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware.\nThe central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer\naccelerating a single memory-bound layer.

    "summary": "Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that\ncollectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human\ncognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability\nemerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker\nin ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial\narchitectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining\nobjectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a\nlow-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal\nactively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations\ndegrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,\nimplying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining\nobjective.

However, directly training the vision transformers may\nyield unstable and sub-optimal results. Recent works propose to improve the\nperformance of the vision transformers by modifying the transformer structures,\ne.g., incorporating convolution layers. In contrast, we investigate an\northogonal approach to stabilize the vision transformer training without\nmodifying the networks. We observe the instability of the training can be\nattributed to the significant similarity across the extracted patch\nrepresentations. More specifically, for deep vision transformers, the\nself-attention blocks tend to map different patches into similar latent\nrepresentations, yielding information loss and performance degradation. To\nalleviate this problem, in this work, we introduce novel loss functions in\nvision transformer training to explicitly encourage diversity across patch\nrepresentations for more discriminative feature extraction. We empirically show\nthat our proposed techniques stabilize the training and allow us to train wider\nand deeper vision transformers. We further show the diversified features\nsignificantly benefit the downstream tasks in transfer learning.

However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much\nprogress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned\nrepresentations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'\nfeatures. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer\nlearning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and\nmulti-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the\nperformance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual\nConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones\n(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that\nindicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.\n  We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13\ndownstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained\nclassification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth\nestimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More\nspecifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network\nfine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have\nsuch a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in\nmulti-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually\nbeneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant\ntasks.

On the other hand, Graph Transformers without\nmessage-passing often perform poorly on smaller datasets, where inductive\nbiases are more crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose the Graph Inductive\nbias Transformer (GRIT) -- a new Graph Transformer that incorporates graph\ninductive biases without using message passing. GRIT is based on several\narchitectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified,\nincluding: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk\nprobabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair\nrepresentations, and injection of degree information in each layer.

Previous surveys mainly focused on ConvNet models on a subset of\nvideo segmentation tasks or transformers for classification tasks. Moreover,\ncomponent-wise discussion of transformer-based video segmentation models has\nnot yet received due focus. In addition, previous reviews of interpretability\nmethods focused on transformers for classification, while analysis of video\ntemporal dynamics modelling capabilities of video models received less\nattention. In this survey, we address the above with a thorough discussion of\nvarious categories of video segmentation, a component-wise discussion of the\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based models, and a review of related\ninterpretability methods. We first present an introduction to the different\nvideo segmentation task categories, their objectives, specific challenges and\nbenchmark datasets. Next, we provide a component-wise review of recent\ntransformer-based models and document the state of the art on different video\nsegmentation tasks. Subsequently, we discuss post-hoc and ante-hoc\ninterpretability methods for transformer models and interpretability methods\nfor understanding the role of the temporal dimension in video models. Finally,\nwe conclude our discussion with future research directions.",

    "summary": "Transformers have revolutionized various real-world applications from natural\nlanguage processing to computer vision. However, traditional von-Neumann\ncomputing paradigm faces memory and bandwidth limitations in accelerating\ntransformers owing to their massive model sizes. To this end, In-memory\nComputing (IMC) crossbars based on Non-volatile Memories (NVMs), due to their\nability to perform highly parallelized Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs)\nwith high energy-efficiencies, have emerged as a promising solution for\naccelerating transformers. However, analog MVM operations in crossbars\nintroduce non-idealities, such as stochastic read & write noise, which affect\nthe inference accuracy of the deployed transformers. Specifically, we find\npre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) to be vulnerable on crossbars due to the\nimpact of write noise on the dynamically-generated Key (K) and Value (V)\nmatrices in the attention layers, an effect not accounted for in prior studies.\nWe, thus, propose ClipFormer, a transformation on the K and V matrices during\ninference, to boost the non-ideal accuracies of pre-trained ViT models.\nClipFormer requires no additional hardware and training overhead and is\namenable to transformers deployed on any memristive crossbar platform. Our\nexperiments on Imagenet-1k dataset using pre-trained DeiT-S transformers,\nsubjected to standard training and variation-aware-training, show >10-40%\nhigher non-ideal accuracies at the high write noise regime by applying\nClipFormer.",

    "title": "Comparing Graph Transformers via Positional Encodings",
    "summary": "The distinguishing power of graph transformers is closely tied to the choice\nof positional encoding: features used to augment the base transformer with\ninformation about the graph. There are two primary types of positional\nencoding: absolute positional encodings (APEs) and relative positional\nencodings (RPEs). APEs assign features to each node and are given as input to\nthe transformer. RPEs instead assign a feature to each pair of nodes, e.g.,\ngraph distance, and are used to augment the attention block. A priori, it is\nunclear which method is better for maximizing the power of the resulting graph\ntransformer. In this paper, we aim to understand the relationship between these\ndifferent types of positional encodings. Interestingly, we show that graph\ntransformers using APEs and RPEs are equivalent in terms of distinguishing\npower. In particular, we demonstrate how to interchange APEs and RPEs while\nmaintaining their distinguishing power in terms of graph transformers. Based on\nour theoretical results, we provide a study on several APEs and RPEs (including\nthe resistance distance and the recently introduced stable and expressive\npositional encoding (SPE)) and compare their distinguishing power in terms of\ntransformers. We believe our work will help navigate the huge number of choices\nof positional encoding and will provide guidance on the future design of\npositional encodings for graph transformers.",

    "summary": "New transformer networks have been integrated into object tracking pipelines\nand have demonstrated strong performance on the latest benchmarks. This paper\nfocuses on understanding how transformer trackers behave under adversarial\nattacks and how different attacks perform on tracking datasets as their\nparameters change. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the\neffectiveness of existing adversarial attacks on object trackers with\ntransformer and non-transformer backbones. We experimented on 7 different\ntrackers, including 3 that are transformer-based, and 4 which leverage other\narchitectures. These trackers are tested against 4 recent attack methods to\nassess their performance and robustness on VOT2022ST, UAV123 and GOT10k\ndatasets. Our empirical study focuses on evaluating adversarial robustness of\nobject trackers based on bounding box versus binary mask predictions, and\nattack methods at different levels of perturbations. Interestingly, our study\nfound that altering the perturbation level may not significantly affect the\noverall object tracking results after the attack. Similarly, the sparsity and\nimperceptibility of the attack perturbations may remain stable against\nperturbation level shifts. By applying a specific attack on all transformer\ntrackers, we show that new transformer trackers having a stronger\ncross-attention modeling achieve a greater adversarial robustness on tracking\ndatasets, such as VOT2022ST and GOT10k. Our results also indicate the necessity\nfor new attack methods to effectively tackle the latest types of transformer\ntrackers.

This systematic review\nexamines transformation approaches in the early stages of software development,\nexamining 25 studies on early-stage requirements transformation documented\nbetween 2000 and 2014. The review highlights the widespread use of natural\nlanguage processing techniques, with tools like the Stanford parser and WordNet\nbeing essential. Intermediate models are often used in the transformation\nprocess to bridge the gap between textual requirements and analysis models.\nSignificant advancements have been made in early-stage requirements\ntransformation approaches; however, several areas require attention to enhance\ntheir effectiveness and reliability. A challenge identified is the lack of\nrobust evaluation methods, with most approaches using simple case studies and\nrunning examples for evaluation. This makes it difficult to compare and\nevaluate the performance these approaches. Although most approaches can\ngenerate structural models from textual requirements, many generate incomplete\nmodels with missing elements. Furthermore, requirements traceability is largely\nneglected, with only two approaches addressing it and lacking explicit detail\non how traceability links are maintained during the transformation process.\nThis review emphasize the need for formalized evaluation techniques and greater\ntransparency and accessibility of approaches used in the early-stage\nrequirements transformation.",

    "summary": "End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR), unlike conventional ASR, does\nnot have modules to learn the semantic representation from speech encoder.\nMoreover, the higher frame-rate of speech representation prevents the model to\nlearn the semantic representation properly. Therefore, the models that are\nconstructed by the lower frame-rate of speech encoder lead to better\nperformance. For Transformer-based ASR, the lower frame-rate is not only\nimportant for learning better semantic representation but also for reducing the\ncomputational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism which has O(n^2)\norder of complexity in both training and inference. In this paper, we propose a\nTransformer-based ASR model with the time reduction layer, in which we\nincorporate time reduction layer inside transformer encoder layers in addition\nto traditional sub-sampling methods to input features that further reduce the\nframe-rate.

One of the core limitations of these transformers is\nthe substantial memory consumption due to their full self-attention mechanism.\nTo overcome this, long sequence transformer models, e.g. Longformer and\nBigBird, were proposed with the idea of sparse attention mechanism to reduce\nthe memory usage from quadratic to the sequence length to a linear scale.

    "summary": "The temporal relationships between frames and their influences on video\nquality assessment (VQA) are still under-studied in existing works. These\nrelationships lead to two important types of effects for video quality.\nFirstly, some temporal variations (such as shaking, flicker, and abrupt scene\ntransitions) are causing temporal distortions and lead to extra quality\ndegradations, while other variations (e.g. those related to meaningful\nhappenings) do not. Secondly, the human visual system often has different\nattention to frames with different contents, resulting in their different\nimportance to the overall video quality. Based on prominent time-series\nmodeling ability of transformers, we propose a novel and effective\ntransformer-based VQA method to tackle these two issues. To better\ndifferentiate temporal variations and thus capture the temporal distortions, we\ndesign a transformer-based Spatial-Temporal Distortion Extraction (STDE)\nmodule. To tackle with temporal quality attention, we propose the\nencoder-decoder-like temporal content transformer (TCT). We also introduce the\ntemporal sampling on features to reduce the input length for the TCT, so as to\nimprove the learning effectiveness and efficiency of this module.

Usually, it is\nformulated as a metric learning problem. The core issue of few-shot\nclassification is how to learn (1) consistent representations for images in\nboth support and query sets and (2) effective metric learning for images\nbetween support and query sets. In this paper, we show that the two challenges\ncan be well modeled simultaneously via a unified Query-Support TransFormer\n(QSFormer) model.

It\nadopts the Encoder, Decoder and Cross-Attention to respectively model the\nSupport, Query (image) representation and Metric learning for few-shot\nclassification task. Also, as a complementary to global learning branch, we\nadopt a local patch Transformer to extract structural representation for each\nimage sample by capturing the long-range dependence of local image patches.

    "title": "X-Former: In-Memory Acceleration of Transformers",
    "summary": "Transformers have achieved great success in a wide variety of natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) tasks due to the attention mechanism, which assigns\nan importance score for every word relative to other words in a sequence.\nHowever, these models are very large, often reaching hundreds of billions of\nparameters, and therefore require a large number of DRAM accesses. Hence,\ntraditional deep neural network (DNN) accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs face\nlimitations in processing Transformers efficiently. In-memory accelerators\nbased on non-volatile memory promise to be an effective solution to this\nchallenge, since they provide high storage density while performing massively\nparallel matrix vector multiplications within memory arrays. However, attention\nscore computations, which are frequently used in Transformers (unlike CNNs and\nRNNs), require matrix vector multiplications (MVM) where both operands change\ndynamically for each input. As a result, conventional NVM-based accelerators\nincur high write latency and write energy when used for Transformers, and\nfurther suffer from the low endurance of most NVM technologies. To address\nthese challenges, we present X-Former, a hybrid in-memory hardware accelerator\nthat consists of both NVM and CMOS processing elements to execute transformer\nworkloads efficiently. To improve the hardware utilization of X-Former, we also\npropose a sequence blocking dataflow, which overlaps the computations of the\ntwo processing elements and reduces execution time. Across several benchmarks,\nwe show that X-Former achieves upto 85x and 7.5x improvements in latency and\nenergy over a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 GPU and upto 10.7x and 4.6x improvements\nin latency and energy over a state-of-the-art in-memory NVM accelerator.",

    "summary": "There is a recent trend in the LiDAR perception field towards unifying\nmultiple tasks in a single strong network with improved performance, as opposed\nto using separate networks for each task. In this paper, we introduce a new\nLiDAR multi-task learning paradigm based on the transformer. The proposed\nLiDARFormer utilizes cross-space global contextual feature information and\nexploits cross-task synergy to boost the performance of LiDAR perception tasks\nacross multiple large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Our novel\ntransformer-based framework includes a cross-space transformer module that\nlearns attentive features between the 2D dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) and 3D\nsparse voxel feature maps. Additionally, we propose a transformer decoder for\nthe segmentation task to dynamically adjust the learned features by leveraging\nthe categorical feature representations. Furthermore, we combine the\nsegmentation and detection features in a shared transformer decoder with\ncross-task attention layers to enhance and integrate the object-level and\nclass-level features. LiDARFormer is evaluated on the large-scale nuScenes and\nthe Waymo Open datasets for both 3D detection and semantic segmentation tasks,\nand it outperforms all previously published methods on both tasks. Notably,\nLiDARFormer achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 76.4% L2 mAPH and\n74.3% NDS on the challenging Waymo and nuScenes detection benchmarks for a\nsingle model LiDAR-only method.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many\nnatural language processing tasks. The self-attention architecture allows\ntransformer to combine information from all elements of a sequence into\ncontext-aware representations. However, information about the context is stored\nmostly in the same element-wise representations. This might limit the\nprocessing of properties related to the sequence as a whole more difficult.\nAdding trainable memory to selectively store local as well as global\nrepresentations of a sequence is a promising direction to improve the\nTransformer model. Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) extend traditional\nneural architectures with general-purpose memory for representations. MANNs\nhave demonstrated the capability to learn simple algorithms like Copy or\nReverse and can be successfully trained via backpropagation on diverse tasks\nfrom question answering to language modeling outperforming RNNs and LSTMs of\ncomparable complexity. In this work, we propose and study few extensions of the\nTransformer baseline (1) by adding memory tokens to store non-local\nrepresentations, (2) creating memory bottleneck for the global information, (3)\ncontrolling memory update with dedicated layer. We evaluate these memory\naugmented Transformers and demonstrate that presence of memory positively\ncorrelates with the model performance for machine translation and language\nmodelling tasks.

Recent works introduce the promising Transformer architecture into\ndeep video inpainting and achieve better performance.

Towards\nthis end, we propose a novel Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) for\nimproving video inpainting with exceptional efficiency. Our proposed DSTT\ndisentangles the task of learning spatial-temporal attention into 2 sub-tasks:\none is for attending temporal object movements on different frames at same\nspatial locations, which is achieved by temporally-decoupled Transformer block,\nand the other is for attending similar background textures on same frame of all\nspatial positions, which is achieved by spatially-decoupled Transformer block.\nThe interweaving stack of such two blocks makes our proposed model attend\nbackground textures and moving objects more precisely, and thus the attended\nplausible and temporally-coherent appearance can be propagated to fill the\nholes. In addition, a hierarchical encoder is adopted before the stack of\nTransformer blocks, for learning robust and hierarchical features that maintain\nmulti-level local spatial structure, resulting in the more representative token\nvectors.

Structural models that based on attention mechanism can not\nonly record the relationships between features position, but also can measure\nthe importance of different features based on their weights.

Therefore, the efficiency of deep learning algorithms can be\nsignificantly elevated and improved. Although transformers have been performed\nvery well in many fields including reinforcement learning, there are still many\nproblems and applications can be solved and made with transformers within this\narea.

Nevertheless, vision transformers treat an image as\n1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in\nmodeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance.\nAlternatively, they require large-scale training data and longer training\nschedules to learn the IB implicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel Vision\nTransformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, ie, ViTAE.\nTechnically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample\nand embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context by using\nmultiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires\nan intrinsic scale invariance IB and is able to learn robust feature\nrepresentation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer\nlayer, ViTAE has a convolution block in parallel to the multi-head\nself-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward\nnetwork. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn\nlocal features and global dependencies collaboratively.

Moreover, there is no method currently built for an\nintrinsically interpretable transformer, which is able to explain its reasoning\nprocess and provide a faithful explanation. To close these crucial gaps, we\npropose a novel vision transformer dubbed the eXplainable Vision Transformer\n(eX-ViT), an intrinsically interpretable transformer model that is able to\njointly discover robust interpretable features and perform the prediction.\nSpecifically, eX-ViT is composed of the Explainable Multi-Head Attention\n(E-MHA) module, the Attribute-guided Explainer (AttE) module and the\nself-supervised attribute-guided loss. The E-MHA tailors explainable attention\nweights that are able to learn semantically interpretable representations from\nlocal patches in terms of model decisions with noise robustness. Meanwhile,\nAttE is proposed to encode discriminative attribute features for the target\nobject through diverse attribute discovery, which constitutes faithful evidence\nfor the model's predictions. In addition, a self-supervised attribute-guided\nloss is developed for our eX-ViT, which aims at learning enhanced\nrepresentations through the attribute discriminability mechanism and attribute\ndiversity mechanism, to localize diverse and discriminative attributes and\ngenerate more robust explanations. As a result, we can uncover faithful and\nrobust interpretations with diverse attributes through the proposed eX-ViT.",

    "summary": "Recently, the vision transformer and its variants have played an increasingly\nimportant role in both monocular and multi-view human pose estimation.\nConsidering image patches as tokens, transformers can model the global\ndependencies within the entire image or across images from other views.\nHowever, global attention is computationally expensive. As a consequence, it is\ndifficult to scale up these transformer-based methods to high-resolution\nfeatures and many views.\n  In this paper, we propose the token-Pruned Pose Transformer (PPT) for 2D\nhuman pose estimation, which can locate a rough human mask and performs\nself-attention only within selected tokens. Furthermore, we extend our PPT to\nmulti-view human pose estimation. Built upon PPT, we propose a new cross-view\nfusion strategy, called human area fusion, which considers all human foreground\npixels as corresponding candidates. Experimental results on COCO and MPII\ndemonstrate that our PPT can match the accuracy of previous pose transformer\nmethods while reducing the computation. Moreover, experiments on Human 3.6M and\nSki-Pose demonstrate that our Multi-view PPT can efficiently fuse cues from\nmultiple views and achieve new state-of-the-art results.",

The Cyrillic-Traditional Mongolian Bidirectional Conversion\n(CTMBC) task includes two conversion processes, including Cyrillic Mongolian to\nTraditional Mongolian (C2T) and Traditional Mongolian to Cyrillic Mongolian\nconversions (T2C).

    "summary": "Transformer, as an alternative to CNN, has been proven effective in many\nmodalities (e.g., texts and images). For 3D point cloud transformers, existing\nefforts focus primarily on pushing their accuracy to the state-of-the-art\nlevel. However, their latency lags behind sparse convolution-based models (3x\nslower), hindering their usage in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive\napplications (such as autonomous driving). This inefficiency comes from point\nclouds' sparse and irregular nature, whereas transformers are designed for\ndense, regular workloads. This paper presents FlatFormer to close this latency\ngap by trading spatial proximity for better computational regularity. We first\nflatten the point cloud with window-based sorting and partition points into\ngroups of equal sizes rather than windows of equal shapes. This effectively\navoids expensive structuring and padding overheads. We then apply\nself-attention within groups to extract local features, alternate sorting axis\nto gather features from different directions, and shift windows to exchange\nfeatures across groups. FlatFormer delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on Waymo\nOpen Dataset with 4.6x speedup over (transformer-based) SST and 1.4x speedup\nover (sparse convolutional) CenterPoint. This is the first point cloud\ntransformer that achieves real-time performance on edge GPUs and is faster than\nsparse convolutional methods while achieving on-par or even superior accuracy\non large-scale benchmarks.",

    "summary": "While CNN-based methods have been the cornerstone of medical image\nsegmentation due to their promising performance and robustness, they suffer\nfrom limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based\napproaches are currently prevailing since they enlarge the reception field to\nmodel global contextual correlation. To further extract rich representations,\nsome extensions of the U-Net employ multi-scale feature extraction and fusion\nmodules and obtain improved performance. Inspired by this idea, we propose\nTransCeption for medical image segmentation, a pure transformer-based U-shape\nnetwork featured by incorporating the inception-like module into the encoder\nand adopting a contextual bridge for better feature fusion. The design proposed\nin this work is based on three core principles: (1) The patch merging module in\nthe encoder is redesigned with ResInception Patch Merging (RIPM). Multi-branch\ntransformer (MB transformer) adopts the same number of branches as the outputs\nof RIPM. Combining the two modules enables the model to capture a multi-scale\nrepresentation within a single stage. (2) We construct an Intra-stage Feature\nFusion (IFF) module following the MB transformer to enhance the aggregation of\nfeature maps from all the branches and particularly focus on the interaction\nbetween the different channels of all the scales. (3) In contrast to a bridge\nthat only contains token-wise self-attention, we propose a Dual Transformer\nBridge that also includes channel-wise self-attention to exploit correlations\nbetween scales at different stages from a dual perspective. Extensive\nexperiments on multi-organ and skin lesion segmentation tasks present the\nsuperior performance of TransCeption compared to previous work.

We also thoroughly test FLTs on\nother data modalities and tasks, such as image classification, 3D molecular\nmodeling, and learnable optimizers.

    "summary": "Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which aims at measuring heart activities\nand physiological signals from facial video without any contact, has great\npotential in many applications (e.g., remote healthcare and affective\ncomputing). Recent deep learning approaches focus on mining subtle rPPG clues\nusing convolutional neural networks with limited spatio-temporal receptive\nfields, which neglect the long-range spatio-temporal perception and interaction\nfor rPPG modeling. In this paper, we propose two end-to-end video transformer\nbased architectures, namely PhysFormer and PhysFormer++, to adaptively\naggregate both local and global spatio-temporal features for rPPG\nrepresentation enhancement. As key modules in PhysFormer, the temporal\ndifference transformers first enhance the quasi-periodic rPPG features with\ntemporal difference guided global attention, and then refine the local\nspatio-temporal representation against interference. To better exploit the\ntemporal contextual and periodic rPPG clues, we also extend the PhysFormer to\nthe two-pathway SlowFast based PhysFormer++ with temporal difference periodic\nand cross-attention transformers. Furthermore, we propose the label\ndistribution learning and a curriculum learning inspired dynamic constraint in\nfrequency domain, which provide elaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and\nPhysFormer++ and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments are performed\non four benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and\ncross-dataset testings. Unlike most transformer networks needed pretraining\nfrom large-scale datasets, the proposed PhysFormer family can be easily trained\nfrom scratch on rPPG datasets, which makes it promising as a novel transformer\nbaseline for the rPPG community.",

We also designed a\ntwo-stage fusion module, multimodal bilinear pooling (MBP), to assist HST in\nfurther fusing multi-receptive field information and combining low-level and\nhigh-level semantic information for accurate localization of lesion regions. In\naddition, we developed adaptive patch embedding (APE) and soft channel\nattention (SCA) modules to retain more valuable information when acquiring\npatch embedding and filtering channel features, respectively, thereby improving\nmodel segmentation quality.

    "title": "DA-TransUNet: Integrating Spatial and Channel Dual Attention with\n  Transformer U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation",
    "summary": "Accurate medical image segmentation is critical for disease quantification\nand treatment evaluation. While traditional Unet architectures and their\ntransformer-integrated variants excel in automated segmentation tasks. However,\nthey lack the ability to harness the intrinsic position and channel features of\nimage. Existing models also struggle with parameter efficiency and\ncomputational complexity, often due to the extensive use of Transformers. To\naddress these issues, this study proposes a novel deep medical image\nsegmentation framework, called DA-TransUNet, aiming to integrate the\nTransformer and dual attention block(DA-Block) into the traditional U-shaped\narchitecture. Unlike earlier transformer-based U-net models, DA-TransUNet\nutilizes Transformers and DA-Block to integrate not only global and local\nfeatures, but also image-specific positional and channel features, improving\nthe performance of medical image segmentation. By incorporating a DA-Block at\nthe embedding layer and within each skip connection layer, we substantially\nenhance feature extraction capabilities and improve the efficiency of the\nencoder-decoder structure. DA-TransUNet demonstrates superior performance in\nmedical image segmentation tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art\ntechniques across multiple datasets. In summary, DA-TransUNet offers a\nsignificant advancement in medical image segmentation, providing an effective\nand powerful alternative to existing techniques. Our architecture stands out\nfor its ability to improve segmentation accuracy, thereby advancing the field\nof automated medical image diagnostics.

    "summary": "Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing\ntransformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images\nor videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for\nmassive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are\nubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical\nsimulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based\nservices (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for\nmassive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including\nimplicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in\ncontinuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high\ncomputational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points,\nand the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer\nmodel, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a\nquad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation.\nWe also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction\nconfidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs.\nExtensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our\nmethod outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can\nscale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

    "summary": "Cyber attacks are often identified using system and network logs. There have\nbeen significant prior works that utilize provenance graphs and ML techniques\nto detect attacks, specifically advanced persistent threats, which are very\ndifficult to detect. Lately, there have been studies where transformer-based\nlanguage models are being used to detect various types of attacks from system\nlogs. However, no such attempts have been made in the case of APTs. In\naddition, existing state-of-the-art techniques that use system provenance\ngraphs, lack a data processing framework generalized across datasets for\noptimal performance. For mitigating this limitation as well as exploring the\neffectiveness of transformer-based language models, this paper proposes\nLogShield, a framework designed to detect APT attack patterns leveraging the\npower of self-attention in transformers. We incorporate customized embedding\nlayers to effectively capture the context of event sequences derived from\nprovenance graphs. While acknowledging the computational overhead associated\nwith training transformer networks, our framework surpasses existing LSTM and\nLanguage models regarding APT detection. We integrated the model parameters and\ntraining procedure from the RoBERTa model and conducted extensive experiments\non well-known APT datasets (DARPA OpTC and DARPA TC E3). Our framework achieved\nsuperior F1 scores of 98% and 95% on the two datasets respectively, surpassing\nthe F1 scores of 96% and 94% obtained by LSTM models. Our findings suggest that\nLogShield's performance benefits from larger datasets and demonstrates its\npotential for generalization across diverse domains. These findings contribute\nto the advancement of APT attack detection methods and underscore the\nsignificance of transformer-based architectures in addressing security\nchallenges in computer systems.",

    "summary": "Models based on the Transformer neural network architecture have seen success\non a wide variety of tasks that appear to require complex \"cognitive branching\"\n-- or the ability to maintain pursuit of one goal while accomplishing others.\nIn cognitive neuroscience, success on such tasks is thought to rely on\nsophisticated frontostriatal mechanisms for selective \\textit{gating}, which\nenable role-addressable updating -- and later readout -- of information to and\nfrom distinct \"addresses\" of memory, in the form of clusters of neurons.\nHowever, Transformer models have no such mechanisms intentionally built-in. It\nis thus an open question how Transformers solve such tasks, and whether the\nmechanisms that emerge to help them to do so bear any resemblance to the gating\nmechanisms in the human brain. In this work, we analyze the mechanisms that\nemerge within a vanilla attention-only Transformer trained on a simple sequence\nmodeling task inspired by a task explicitly designed to study working memory\ngating in computational cognitive neuroscience. We find that, as a result of\ntraining, the self-attention mechanism within the Transformer specializes in a\nway that mirrors the input and output gating mechanisms which were explicitly\nincorporated into earlier, more biologically-inspired architectures.

    "summary": "Exploring motion information is important for the motion deblurring task.\nRecent the window-based transformer approaches have achieved decent performance\nin image deblurring. Note that the motion causing blurry results is usually\ncomposed of translation and rotation movements and the window-shift operation\nin the Cartesian coordinate system by the window-based transformer approaches\nonly directly explores translation motion in orthogonal directions. Thus, these\nmethods have the limitation of modeling the rotation part. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce the polar coordinate-based transformer, which has the\nangles and distance to explore rotation motion and translation information\ntogether. In this paper, we propose a Radial Strip Transformer (RST), which is\na transformer-based architecture that restores the blur images in a polar\ncoordinate system instead of a Cartesian one. RST contains a dynamic radial\nembedding module (DRE) to extract the shallow feature by a radial deformable\nconvolution. We design a polar mask layer to generate the offsets for the\ndeformable convolution, which can reshape the convolution kernel along the\nradius to better capture the rotation motion information. Furthermore, we\nproposed a radial strip attention solver (RSAS) as deep feature extraction,\nwhere the relationship of windows is organized by azimuth and radius. This\nattention module contains radial strip windows to reweight image features in\nthe polar coordinate, which preserves more useful information in rotation and\ntranslation motion together for better recovering the sharp images.\nExperimental results on six synthesis and real-world datasets prove that our\nmethod performs favorably against other SOTA methods for the image deblurring\ntask.",

    "summary": "Affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) are increasingly recognized for\ntheir potential in monitoring and interpreting emotional states through\nelectroencephalography (EEG) signals. Current EEG-based emotion recognition\nmethods perform well with short segments of EEG data. However, these methods\nencounter significant challenges in real-life scenarios where emotional states\nevolve over extended periods. To address this issue, we propose a Dual\nAttentive (DuA) transformer framework for long-term continuous EEG emotion\nanalysis. Unlike segment-based approaches, the DuA transformer processes an\nentire EEG trial as a whole, identifying emotions at the trial level, referred\nto as trial-based emotion analysis. This framework is designed to adapt to\nvarying signal lengths, providing a substantial advantage over traditional\nmethods. The DuA transformer incorporates three key modules: the\nspatial-spectral network module, the temporal network module, and the transfer\nlearning module. The spatial-spectral network module simultaneously captures\nspatial and spectral information from EEG signals, while the temporal network\nmodule detects temporal dependencies within long-term EEG data. The transfer\nlearning module enhances the model's adaptability across different subjects and\nconditions. We extensively evaluate the DuA transformer using a\nself-constructed long-term EEG emotion database, along with two benchmark EEG\nemotion databases. On the basis of the trial-based leave-one-subject-out\ncross-subject cross-validation protocol, our experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed DuA transformer significantly outperforms existing methods in\nlong-term continuous EEG emotion analysis, with an average enhancement of\n5.28%.",

However, these Transformer-based approaches\nencounter a significant drawback: the computational costs escalate\nquadratically due to the self-attention mechanism in the Transformer Encoder,\nparticularly when dealing with high-resolution images or long context\nsentences. This quadratic increase in computational burden restricts the\napplicability of visual grounding to more intricate scenes, such as\nconversation-based reasoning segmentation, which involves lengthy language\nexpressions. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective multi-task\nvisual grounding (EEVG) framework based on Transformer Decoder to address this\nissue, which reduces the cost in both language and visual aspects. In the\nlanguage aspect, we employ the Transformer Decoder to fuse visual and\nlinguistic features, where linguistic features are input as memory and visual\nfeatures as queries. This allows fusion to scale linearly with language\nexpression length. In the visual aspect, we introduce a parameter-free approach\nto reduce computation by eliminating background visual tokens based on\nattention scores.

However, forecasting multivariate time series with\nTransformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal\n(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based\nmodels have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both\nsequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate\nthese two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture\nwhile optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the\nTransformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate\ndependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into\na variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then\nmodels cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned\nembeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling\nphases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most\nrelevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be\nseamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,\ndelivering performance improvements up to 20.7\\% over original models.

    "summary": "This paper presents $\\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\\mathbf{linear}$-based\nmultivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an\n$\\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically\nadopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode\ntime series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies\nin series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some\nforecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using\nfixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier\ntransform). In contrast, we utilize $\\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive\ntransformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series'\ntemporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective\nencoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a\nplug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation\nlearning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer,\n$\\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture\nmultivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising\nperformance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly\nhalf the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting\ntasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for\nself-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based\nforecasters.

    "summary": "This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion\ntransformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective\ncaching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache\ninto the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and\nfeed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the\ndenoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative\nerrors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that\nminimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency,\na unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from\nself-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and\nSeed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step\nconfigurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces\ninference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower\nsteps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total\nnumber of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the\neffectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving\ncomputational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step\ninference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under\nhigh-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching\nis a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models\nwithout requiring architectural changes or retraining.

However, like other models operating\non videos, they are prone to learning spurious correlations from non-diagnostic\nregions such as image backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we propose the\nVideo Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that\nintegrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture. ViACT\nrepresents a deforming anatomical structure as a point set and encodes both its\nspatial geometry and corresponding image patches into transformer tokens.\nDuring pre-training, ViACT follows a masked autoencoding strategy that masks\nand reconstructs only anatomical patches, enforcing that representation\nlearning is focused on the anatomical region. The pre-trained model can then be\nfine-tuned for tasks localized to this region. In this work we focus on the\nmyocardium, demonstrating the framework on echo analysis tasks such as left\nventricular ejection fraction (EF) regression and cardiac amyloidosis (CA)\ndetection. The anatomical constraint focuses transformer attention within the\nmyocardium, yielding interpretable attention maps aligned with regions of known\nCA pathology.

    "summary": "Transformers are successfully applied to computer vision due to their\npowerful modeling capacity with self-attention. However, the excellent\nperformance of transformers heavily depends on enormous training images. Thus,\na data-efficient transformer solution is urgently needed. In this work, we\npropose an early knowledge distillation framework, which is termed as DearKD,\nto improve the data efficiency required by transformers. Our DearKD is a\ntwo-stage framework that first distills the inductive biases from the early\nintermediate layers of a CNN and then gives the transformer full play by\ntraining without distillation. Further, our DearKD can be readily applied to\nthe extreme data-free case where no real images are available. In this case, we\npropose a boundary-preserving intra-divergence loss based on DeepInversion to\nfurther close the performance gap against the full-data counterpart. Extensive\nexperiments on ImageNet, partial ImageNet, data-free setting and other\ndownstream tasks prove the superiority of DearKD over its baselines and\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "In this work, we present Point Transformer, a deep neural network that\noperates directly on unordered and unstructured point sets. We design Point\nTransformer to extract local and global features and relate both\nrepresentations by introducing the local-global attention mechanism, which aims\nto capture spatial point relations and shape information. For that purpose, we\npropose SortNet, as part of the Point Transformer, which induces input\npermutation invariance by selecting points based on a learned score. The output\nof Point Transformer is a sorted and permutation invariant feature list that\ncan directly be incorporated into common computer vision applications. We\nevaluate our approach on standard classification and part segmentation\nbenchmarks to demonstrate competitive results compared to the prior work.

In this work, we study this curiously underpopulated area of Bayesian\ntransformers. We find that weight-space inference in transformers does not work\nwell, regardless of the approximate posterior.

However, it is difficult to apply such networks to 3D object\ndetection in autonomous driving due to its large computation cost and slow\nreasoning speed. In this work, we present TED, an efficient\nTransformation-Equivariant 3D Detector to overcome the computation cost and\nspeed issues. TED first applies a sparse convolution backbone to extract\nmulti-channel transformation-equivariant voxel features; and then aligns and\naggregates these equivariant features into lightweight and compact\nrepresentations for high-performance 3D object detection. On the highly\ncompetitive KITTI 3D car detection leaderboard, TED ranked 1st among all\nsubmissions with competitive efficiency.",

    "summary": "We propose an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate\ntime series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is\nbased on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into\nsubseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii)\nchannel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time\nseries that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the\nseries. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic\ninformation is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the\nattention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and\nthe model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series\nTransformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy\nsignificantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also\napply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent\nfine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large\ndatasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to\nothers also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST.",

    "title": "Linear Transformers are Versatile In-Context Learners",
    "summary": "Recent research has demonstrated that transformers, particularly linear\nattention models, implicitly execute gradient-descent-like algorithms on data\nprovided in-context during their forward inference step. However, their\ncapability in handling more complex problems remains unexplored. In this paper,\nwe prove that each layer of a linear transformer maintains a weight vector for\nan implicit linear regression problem and can be interpreted as performing a\nvariant of preconditioned gradient descent. We also investigate the use of\nlinear transformers in a challenging scenario where the training data is\ncorrupted with different levels of noise. Remarkably, we demonstrate that for\nthis problem linear transformers discover an intricate and highly effective\noptimization algorithm, surpassing or matching in performance many reasonable\nbaselines. We analyze this algorithm and show that it is a novel approach\nincorporating momentum and adaptive rescaling based on noise levels. Our\nfindings show that even linear transformers possess the surprising ability to\ndiscover sophisticated optimization strategies.",

    "summary": "In this work, we address two main shortcomings of transformer architectures:\ninput corruption and rank collapse in their output representation. We unveil\nself-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes\nsmoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished\nrepresentation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is\nsensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with\na reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation\ncapacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while\nbolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting\ncontrolled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at\naddressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a\nnovel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at\nimproving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax\ntransformers. We empirically evaluate the model for advantages and robustness\nagainst baseline transformers across various practical tasks, including object\nclassification, image segmentation, and language modeling.",

In this work,\nwe show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches\nis insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of\nTransformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time\nhorizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE\nRepresentations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive\nCoding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the\nagent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on\nthe Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods\nthat do not employ look-ahead search.",

The graph transformer, with\nits advantages of high performance and scalability compared to traditional\ngraph networks, has been widely explored in recent research for applications of\ngraph structures. However, current transformer-based graph decoders struggle to\neffectively utilize graph information, which limits their capacity to leverage\nonly sequences of nodes rather than the complex topological structures of\nmolecule graphs. This paper focuses on building a graph transformer-based\nframework for molecular generation, which we call \\textbf{JTreeformer} as it\ntransforms graph generation into junction tree generation. It combines GCN\nparallel with multi-head attention as the encoder. It integrates a directed\nacyclic GCN into a graph-based Transformer to serve as a decoder, which can\niteratively synthesize the entire molecule by leveraging information from the\npartially constructed molecular structure at each step. In addition, a\ndiffusion model is inserted in the latent space generated by the encoder, to\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of sampling further. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that our novel framework outperforms existing molecule\ngeneration methods, thus offering a promising tool to advance drug discovery\n(https://anonymous.4open.science/r/JTreeformer-C74C).",

Long sequence\ntime-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model,\nwhich is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between\noutput and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of\nTransformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several\nsevere issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable\nto LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent\nlimitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we\ndesign an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with\nthree distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism,\nwhich achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has\ncomparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the\nself-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading\nlayer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the\ngenerative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long\ntime-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way,\nwhich drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions.\nExtensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the\nLSTF problem.",

    "summary": "In recent years, the Transformer architecture has proven to be very\nsuccessful in sequence processing, but its application to other data\nstructures, such as graphs, has remained limited due to the difficulty of\nproperly defining positions. Here, we present the $\\textit{Spectral Attention\nNetwork}$ (SAN), which uses a learned positional encoding (LPE) that can take\nadvantage of the full Laplacian spectrum to learn the position of each node in\na given graph. This LPE is then added to the node features of the graph and\npassed to a fully-connected Transformer. By leveraging the full spectrum of the\nLaplacian, our model is theoretically powerful in distinguishing graphs, and\ncan better detect similar sub-structures from their resonance. Further, by\nfully connecting the graph, the Transformer does not suffer from\nover-squashing, an information bottleneck of most GNNs, and enables better\nmodeling of physical phenomenons such as heat transfer and electric\ninteraction. When tested empirically on a set of 4 standard datasets, our model\nperforms on par or better than state-of-the-art GNNs, and outperforms any\nattention-based model by a wide margin, becoming the first fully-connected\narchitecture to perform well on graph benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications,\nsuch as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption\nplanning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series.\nPrior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to\ndiscover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of\nthe long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.\nAlso, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise\nself-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information\nutilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a\nnovel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break\nwith the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a\nbasic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with\nprogressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired\nby the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism\nbased on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and\nrepresentation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation\noutperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term\nforecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative\nimprovement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,\ntraffic, economics, weather and disease.

However, the core of Transformer, the self-attention\nmechanism, has a quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the\nsequence length, which hinders applications of Transformer-based models to long\nsequences. Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate this problem, such as\nsparse attention mechanisms, low-rank matrix approximations and scalable\nkernels, and token mixing alternatives to self-attention. We propose a novel\nPooling Network (PoNet) for token mixing in long sequences with linear\ncomplexity.

On the Long Range Arena benchmark, PoNet significantly outperforms\nTransformer and achieves competitive accuracy, while being only slightly slower\nthan the fastest model, FNet, across all sequence lengths measured on GPUs. We\nalso conduct systematic studies on the transfer learning capability of PoNet\nand observe that PoNet achieves 95.7% of the accuracy of BERT on the GLUE\nbenchmark, outperforming FNet by 4.5% relative.

Convolutional neural\nnetworks use a variety of frequency- and orientation-specific kernels to\nidentify objects subject to different transformations; these require many\nparameters. Sampling equivariant networks can adjust sampling from input\nfeature maps according to the transformation of the object, allowing a kernel\nto extract features of an object under different transformations. Doing so\nrequires fewer parameters, and makes the network more suitable for representing\ndeformable objects, like those in aerial images. However, methods like\ndeformable convolutional networks can only provide sampling equivariance under\ncertain circumstances, because of the locations used for sampling. We propose\nsampling equivariant self-attention networks which consider self-attention\nrestricted to a local image patch as convolution sampling with masks instead of\nlocations, and design a transformation embedding module to further improve the\nequivariant sampling ability.

    "summary": "Recent advances in Vision Transformer (ViT) have demonstrated its impressive\nperformance in image classification, which makes it a promising alternative to\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). Unlike CNNs, ViT represents an input image\nas a sequence of image patches. The patch-based input image representation\nmakes the following question interesting: How does ViT perform when individual\ninput image patches are perturbed with natural corruptions or adversarial\nperturbations, compared to CNNs? In this work, we study the robustness of ViT\nto patch-wise perturbations. Surprisingly, we find that ViTs are more robust to\nnaturally corrupted patches than CNNs, whereas they are more vulnerable to\nadversarial patches. Furthermore, we discover that the attention mechanism\ngreatly affects the robustness of vision transformers. Specifically, the\nattention module can help improve the robustness of ViT by effectively ignoring\nnatural corrupted patches. However, when ViTs are attacked by an adversary, the\nattention mechanism can be easily fooled to focus more on the adversarially\nperturbed patches and cause a mistake. Based on our analysis, we propose a\nsimple temperature-scaling based method to improve the robustness of ViT\nagainst adversarial patches.

    "summary": "Prior works have proposed several strategies to reduce the computational cost\nof self-attention mechanism. Many of these works consider decomposing the\nself-attention procedure into regional and local feature extraction procedures\nthat each incurs a much smaller computational complexity. However, regional\ninformation is typically only achieved at the expense of undesirable\ninformation lost owing to down-sampling. In this paper, we propose a novel\nTransformer architecture that aims to mitigate the cost issue, named Dual\nVision Transformer (Dual-ViT). The new architecture incorporates a critical\nsemantic pathway that can more efficiently compress token vectors into global\nsemantics with reduced order of complexity. Such compressed global semantics\nthen serve as useful prior information in learning finer pixel level details,\nthrough another constructed pixel pathway. The semantic pathway and pixel\npathway are then integrated together and are jointly trained, spreading the\nenhanced self-attention information in parallel through both of the pathways.\nDual-ViT is henceforth able to reduce the computational complexity without\ncompromising much accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that Dual-ViT provides\nsuperior accuracy than SOTA Transformer architectures with reduced training\ncomplexity.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in vision backbones have significantly improved their\nperformance by simultaneously modeling images' local and global contexts.\nHowever, the bidirectional interaction between these two contexts has not been\nwell explored and exploited, which is important in the human visual system.\nThis paper proposes a Fully Adaptive Self-Attention (FASA) mechanism for vision\ntransformer to model the local and global information as well as the\nbidirectional interaction between them in context-aware ways. Specifically,\nFASA employs self-modulated convolutions to adaptively extract local\nrepresentation while utilizing self-attention in down-sampled space to extract\nglobal representation. Subsequently, it conducts a bidirectional adaptation\nprocess between local and global representation to model their interaction. In\naddition, we introduce a fine-grained downsampling strategy to enhance the\ndown-sampled self-attention mechanism for finer-grained global perception\ncapability. Based on FASA, we develop a family of lightweight vision backbones,\nFully Adaptive Transformer (FAT) family. Extensive experiments on multiple\nvision tasks demonstrate that FAT achieves impressive performance. Notably, FAT\naccomplishes a 77.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only 4.5M parameters and\n0.7G FLOPs, which surpasses the most advanced ConvNets and Transformers with\nsimilar model size and computational costs. Moreover, our model exhibits faster\nspeed on modern GPU compared to other models. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/qhfan/FAT.",

    "title": "Learning Content-enhanced Mask Transformer for Domain Generalized\n  Urban-Scene Segmentation",
    "summary": "Domain-generalized urban-scene semantic segmentation (USSS) aims to learn\ngeneralized semantic predictions across diverse urban-scene styles. Unlike\ndomain gap challenges, USSS is unique in that the semantic categories are often\nsimilar in different urban scenes, while the styles can vary significantly due\nto changes in urban landscapes, weather conditions, lighting, and other\nfactors. Existing approaches typically rely on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to learn the content of urban scenes.\n  In this paper, we propose a Content-enhanced Mask TransFormer (CMFormer) for\ndomain-generalized USSS. The main idea is to enhance the focus of the\nfundamental component, the mask attention mechanism, in Transformer\nsegmentation models on content information. To achieve this, we introduce a\nnovel content-enhanced mask attention mechanism. It learns mask queries from\nboth the image feature and its down-sampled counterpart, as lower-resolution\nimage features usually contain more robust content information and are less\nsensitive to style variations. These features are fused into a Transformer\ndecoder and integrated into a multi-resolution content-enhanced mask attention\nlearning scheme.\n  Extensive experiments conducted on various domain-generalized urban-scene\nsegmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed CMFormer significantly\noutperforms existing CNN-based methods for domain-generalized semantic\nsegmentation, achieving improvements of up to 14.00\\% in terms of mIoU (mean\nintersection over union).

    "title": "MeT: A Graph Transformer for Semantic Segmentation of 3D Meshes",
    "summary": "Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3D\nshapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturing\nnon-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in the\nmesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularly\nchallenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressed\nthrough CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformers\nhave gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achieving\nperformance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-sought\narchitecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-based\nmethod for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling of\nthe graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. In\norder to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures in\nmodeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3D\nmeshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positional\nencoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacing\nthe traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducing\nclustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attention\noperators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG\nDataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 and\non the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yields\nstate-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.",

    "summary": "Recent works have empirically analyzed in-context learning and shown that\ntransformers trained on synthetic linear regression tasks can learn to\nimplement ridge regression, which is the Bayes-optimal predictor, given\nsufficient capacity [Aky\\\"urek et al., 2023], while one-layer transformers with\nlinear self-attention and no MLP layer will learn to implement one step of\ngradient descent (GD) on a least-squares linear regression objective [von\nOswald et al., 2022]. However, the theory behind these observations remains\npoorly understood. We theoretically study transformers with a single layer of\nlinear self-attention, trained on synthetic noisy linear regression data.\nFirst, we mathematically show that when the covariates are drawn from a\nstandard Gaussian distribution, the one-layer transformer which minimizes the\npre-training loss will implement a single step of GD on the least-squares\nlinear regression objective. Then, we find that changing the distribution of\nthe covariates and weight vector to a non-isotropic Gaussian distribution has a\nstrong impact on the learned algorithm: the global minimizer of the\npre-training loss now implements a single step of $\\textit{pre-conditioned}$\nGD. However, if only the distribution of the responses is changed, then this\ndoes not have a large effect on the learned algorithm: even when the response\ncomes from a more general family of $\\textit{nonlinear}$ functions, the global\nminimizer of the pre-training loss still implements a single step of GD on a\nleast-squares linear regression objective.",

    "summary": "Multivariate time series long-term prediction, which aims to predict the\nchange of data in a long time, can provide references for decision-making.\nAlthough transformer-based models have made progress in this field, they\nusually do not make full use of three features of multivariate time series:\nglobal information, local information, and variables correlation. To\neffectively mine the above three features and establish a high-precision\nprediction model, we propose a double sampling transformer (DSformer), which\nconsists of the double sampling (DS) block and the temporal variable attention\n(TVA) block. Firstly, the DS block employs down sampling and piecewise sampling\nto transform the original series into feature vectors that focus on global\ninformation and local information respectively. Then, TVA block uses temporal\nattention and variable attention to mine these feature vectors from different\ndimensions and extract key information. Finally, based on a parallel structure,\nDSformer uses multiple TVA blocks to mine and integrate different features\nobtained from DS blocks respectively. The integrated feature information is\npassed to the generative decoder based on a multi-layer perceptron to realize\nmultivariate time series long-term prediction. Experimental results on nine\nreal-world datasets show that DSformer can outperform eight existing baselines.",

    "summary": "Compressed Neural Networks have the potential to enable deep learning across\nnew applications and smaller computational environments. However, understanding\nthe range of learning tasks in which such models can succeed is not well\nstudied. In this work, we apply sparse and binary-weighted Transformers to\nmultivariate time series problems, showing that the lightweight models achieve\naccuracy comparable to that of dense floating-point Transformers of the same\nstructure. Our model achieves favorable results across three time series\nlearning tasks: classification, anomaly detection, and single-step forecasting.\nAdditionally, to reduce the computational complexity of the attention\nmechanism, we apply two modifications, which show little to no decline in model\nperformance: 1) in the classification task, we apply a fixed mask to the query,\nkey, and value activations, and 2) for forecasting and anomaly detection, which\nrely on predicting outputs at a single point in time, we propose an attention\nmask to allow computation only at the current time step. Together, each\ncompression technique and attention modification substantially reduces the\nnumber of non-zero operations necessary in the Transformer. We measure the\ncomputational savings of our approach over a range of metrics including\nparameter count, bit size, and floating point operation (FLOPs) count, showing\nup to a 53x reduction in storage size and up to 10.5x reduction in FLOPs.",

    "summary": "The video grounding (VG) task aims to locate the queried action or event in\nan untrimmed video based on rich linguistic descriptions. Existing\nproposal-free methods are trapped in complex interaction between video and\nquery, overemphasizing cross-modal feature fusion and feature correlation for\nVG. In this paper, we propose a novel boundary regression paradigm that\nperforms regression token learning in a transformer. Particularly, we present a\nsimple but effective proposal-free framework, namely Video Grounding\nTransformer (ViGT), which predicts the temporal boundary using a learnable\nregression token rather than multi-modal or cross-modal features. In ViGT, the\nbenefits of a learnable token are manifested as follows. (1) The token is\nunrelated to the video or the query and avoids data bias toward the original\nvideo and query. (2) The token simultaneously performs global context\naggregation from video and query features. First, we employed a sharing feature\nencoder to project both video and query into a joint feature space before\nperforming cross-modal co-attention (i.e., video-to-query attention and\nquery-to-video attention) to highlight discriminative features in each\nmodality. Furthermore, we concatenated a learnable regression token [REG] with\nthe video and query features as the input of a vision-language transformer.\nFinally, we utilized the token [REG] to predict the target moment and visual\nfeatures to constrain the foreground and background probabilities at each\ntimestamp. The proposed ViGT performed well on three public datasets: ANet\nCaptions, TACoS and YouCookII. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative\nanalysis further validated the interpretability of ViGT.",

    "summary": "Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies,\nsuch as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians\nand vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic\nsafety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social\ninteractions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has\nlimitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph\nTransformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph\nConvolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution\npseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and\ninterception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to\nhandle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed\npedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and\nTransformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary\nnumber of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data\nprocessing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle,\nand mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model\nminimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces\nthe likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively\nreduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to\npredict for a long time.",

    "title": "Exploiting Regional Information Transformer for Single Image Deraining",
    "summary": "Transformer-based Single Image Deraining (SID) methods have achieved\nremarkable success, primarily attributed to their robust capability in\ncapturing long-range interactions. However, we've noticed that current methods\nhandle rain-affected and unaffected regions concurrently, overlooking the\ndisparities between these areas, resulting in confusion between rain streaks\nand background parts, and inabilities to obtain effective interactions,\nultimately resulting in suboptimal deraining outcomes. To address the above\nissue, we introduce the Region Transformer (Regformer), a novel SID method that\nunderlines the importance of independently processing rain-affected and\nunaffected regions while considering their combined impact for high-quality\nimage reconstruction. The crux of our method is the innovative Region\nTransformer Block (RTB), which integrates a Region Masked Attention (RMA)\nmechanism and a Mixed Gate Forward Block (MGFB). Our RTB is used for attention\nselection of rain-affected and unaffected regions and local modeling of mixed\nscales. The RMA generates attention maps tailored to these two regions and\ntheir interactions, enabling our model to capture comprehensive features\nessential for rain removal. To better recover high-frequency textures and\ncapture more local details, we develop the MGFB as a compensation module to\ncomplete local mixed scale modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmodel reaches state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving the image\nderaining quality. Our code and trained models are publicly available.",
